//either:
//1 - seperate table to link arcid to hashes. then have option to perm arc so all files will be perm links that are in that arc
//2 - if arc is selected perm the links inside the arc by default this would be better perm link  by default we keep for everything even for file
#zetra:What do you think. Number 1 or number 2? -1- would be more complex but maybe better?#

//todo:
//if perm is selected, ask if they want to store file for rescan, so they don't have to re-upload (good for people selling crypters for users to check themselves)
//above one is good option 
//change 'perm' to 'user' then for the perm put user=perm, just easier for later when we add user system
//kewl one we can display all the hashes file names scanned by that user 
//email on scan complete option

// yup can be done not a problem
//ajax uploader

// can finish this too
#zetra:watcha thing?
