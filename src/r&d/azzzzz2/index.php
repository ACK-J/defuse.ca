<center><h3>What is ____?</h3></center>
It all started with an idea. What if buying lottory tickets wasn't a waste of money? What if you actually had a chance of winning? What if your money wasn't wasted even when you lose? For a long time, we thought that it wasn't possible to answer "yes" to all three questions, but ______ is the answer.
<br /><br />
_____ works differently then any other lotto, instead of getting an impossible chance at an impossible amount of money, you get a real chance at a real amount of money. ______ works by letting only a certain amount of people into a drawing, for example 1000. To get into a drawing, you buy a ticket, which costs only $2. The winner doesn't get chosen until the drawing fills up. So there will be $2000 in the pot. The winner gets the majority, $1500, then, a percentage of the remaining $500 goes to chairty. The winner can also choose to easily donate a percentage of their winnings to a chairty of their choice.
<br /><br />
When you buy in to a drawing, you get to vote on which chairty should receive the extra money. When the winner is chosen, the chairity with the highest amount of votes gets the money.
<br /><br /><br />
<center><h3>Drawing Types</h3></center>
<br />
<center><h4>Newbie</h4></center>
In newbie drawings, only 10 people are let in. Once 10 people have joined the drawing, the pot is $20. $15 goes to the winner and the full $5 is donated to chairity. These drawings happen daily.
<br /><br />
<center><h4>Beginner</h4></center>
In beginner drawings, 100 people are let in. The pot is $200, and $30 is donated to chairty. These drawings happen daily.
<br /><br />
<center><h4>Advanced</h4></center>
In advanced drawings, 1000 people are let in. The pot is $2000, the winner gets $1500 and $300 gets donated to chairty. These drawings happen weekly.
<br /><br />
<center><h4>Over 9000</h4></center>
"Over 9000" drawings are very rare, they don't happen regularly, they seem to appear randomly like pokemon (xD). Over 9000 drawings allow 10 thousand people to enter. The pot comes to 20 thousand. 15 thousand goes to the winner, and the FULL $5000 gets donated to the winning chairty.
<center><h4>MissingNo.</h4></center>
Although it has never been documented, it is rumored that a very mysterious type of drawing exists. The rumor claims that these drawings let 100k people in, meaning the pot comes to a whopping $200k. We like our chairites, and since these drawings are SO rare, if one ever happens, $100k goes to the winner and $100k goes to the winning chairity.
<br /><br />
<center><h3>No Bullshit</h3></center>
______ uses the strongest, proven cryptography to make sure the drawings are ALWAYS fair. _____ uses a third party lotto drawing service called TRENT to chose it's winners. This means anyone can check the math to make there are no biases.
