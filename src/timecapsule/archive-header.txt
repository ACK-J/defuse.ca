This file contains messages to the future. They will only become readable once
large-scale quantum computers exist or once someone makes a breakthrough
discovery allowing these messages to be decrypted with a classical computer.

This time capsule was initiated by Taylor S. Hornby in September of the year
2017. Anyone with access to the above web page was allowed to contribute to the
archive. This document grows in a roughly append-only fashion, and to help
future historians verify the authenticity of the document, I will periodically
embed cryptographic hashes of the document's append-only prefix into some
cryptocurrency's blockchain.

This document begins with the source code (including Dmitry Chestnykh's port of
TweetNaCl to JavaScript) that was used to encrypt the messages. Following the
source code are the encrypted messages, one per line. At the end of the file,
you will find additional information including the list of locations where
I have saved the cryptographic hashes of the prefixes.

Note that the encryption was performed in the message author's web browser, and
hence was subject to modification by the message author. So, some authors may
have chosen to save messages that are not in the correct format. The timestamps
are reliable because they were recorded server-side, but because of possible
clock skew, they should not be considered to be exact.
