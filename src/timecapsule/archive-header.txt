This file contains messages for the future. They will only become readable once
large-scale quantum computers exist or once someone makes a breakthrough
discovery allowing them to be efficiently decrypted with a classical computer.

This time capsule was initiated by Taylor S. Hornby in September of 2017. Anyone
who can access the above webpage and pass Google's "reCAPTCHA" anti-spam check
is allowed to contribute messages to the archive.

This file may not be the latest version of the archive. This document grows in
a (roughly) append-only fashion, and contributors are encouraged to download
a copy of it after they've added their message to help it live on into the
future. To help future historians verify the authenticity of this document,
I plan to periodically embed a cryptographic hash of its longest unchanging
prefix into a cryptocurrency's blockchain.

This document begins with the source code (including Dmitry Chestnykh's port of
TweetNaCl to JavaScript) that is used to encrypt the messages in
a "quantum-vulnerable" way. Next come the timestamped and encrypted messages
themselves, one per line. At the end of the file, you will find additional
information including a list of everywhere I've saved cryptographic hashes of
prefixes of this file.

Note that the encryption code is run in the message author's web browser, and
hence can be modified by the message author. So, some authors may have chosen to
add messages that are not in the correct format. The timestamps are reliable
because they were recorded on the web server using the server's clock, but
because of possible clock skew they should not be considered to be exact.
