<h1>C# Threading Library</h1>
<p>This is a simple and high level job-based threading library for C#. It allows you to define a "job" class and easily execute these "jobs" in parallel. Your client code can be notified when a job is completed through an event, or can call a function that blocks until all jobs are completed.</p>

<p>It should be very straightforward, but I'll get documentation up as soon as I can.</p>
