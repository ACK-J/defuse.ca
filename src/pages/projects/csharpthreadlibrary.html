<h1>C# Threading Library</h1>
<p>This is a simple and high level job-based threading library for C#. It allows you to define a "job" class and easily execute many "jobs" in parallel. Your client code can be notified when a job has completed through a standard C# event, or can call a function that blocks until all jobs have completed.</p>

<p>Example code is included in the download.</p>
