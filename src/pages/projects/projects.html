<h1>Complete Project List</h1>
<p>Here is a list of the projects I've completed, what I'm working on, and what's to come.</p>

<h2>What I've done</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="http://crackstation.net/">CrackStation - Online Hash Cracker (Lookup Table)</a></h3>
		<p>An online hash cracking lookup table, that supports many hash algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD160</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/web-application-security.htm">Why are web applications so vulnerable to attack?</a></h3>
		<p>Using graph theory to enhance our understanding of why web application vulnerabilities are so hard to prevent.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">Salted Password Hashing - Doing it Right</a></h3>
		<p>A clear explanation of the proper way to store hashes in a database.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/helloworld-cms.htm">HelloWorld! Secure &amp; Light CMS System</a></h3>
		<p>An open source, lightweight and secure CMS system in PHP. The very same CMS that this website is using.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/onedetection.htm">PUP Confusion</a></h3>
		<p>A technique for bypassing antivirus detection.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/filesystem-events-ntfs-permissions.htm">File System Events Disclose NTFS Protected Folder Contents</a></h3>
		<p>Using the .NET framework's FileSystemWatcher class, it's possible to monitor a folder and it's sub-folders for file creations, modifications, and deletions. The Windows API fails to take NTFS permissions into account when raising these events. By logging these events, it is possible to obtain a partial list of files inside a private folder. This also extends to folders shared over the network.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/pastebin.htm">Secure, Encrypted, Anonymous Pastebin</a></h3>
		<p>Programmers need a secure way to quickly send code snippets to friends over IM. After noticing that pastebin.com publishes everything you "paste" to the internet, I had to make my own secure version of the service.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/pdfcleaner.htm">PDFCleaner</a></h3>
		<p>Almost weekly we hear about a new exploit for Adobe Reader, the most used program to view PDF files. PDF files have become a major security problem. I decided to fix this by creating a service that lets you "sanitize" a PDF file. PDFCleaner lets you upload any PDF, and gives you the same PDF without any exploits that may have been attached to the original. PDFCleaner is better than antivirus software, because it even works with unknown exploits.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/checksums.htm">Checksum Calculator</a></h3>
		<p>There aren't many trustworthy online hash calculators that support multiple algorithms. The highest ranking md5 hash calculator on google is running on the same server as a hash cracking service, which I found very suspicious. I made my own so that I can be 100% sure that the data I hash isn't getting added to a hash cracking database.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/gpucrack.htm">GPU MD5+Salt Cracker</a></h3>
		<p>Parallel computation is many times faster on a GPU than a CPU. There is lots of code out there for brute forcing plain MD5 hashes using Nvidia's CUDA technology. To get a feel for GPU computing, I wrote a CUDA program that can crack <i>salted</i> MD5 hashes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/passgen.htm">Password Generator</a></h3>
		<p>There are some great websites for generating secure passwords, like <a href="http://grc.com/passwords.htm">GRC's Ultra High Security Password Generator</a>, but I TNO (Trust No One). I made my own offline password generator because I didn't want to trust anyone else's servers with creating my passwords. There are two variants, one written in C# that runs on Windows and Mono, and one written in C++ that runs on Linux/Unix.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/dotnetbench.htm">.NET Benchmark Tool</a></h3>
		<p>A simple benchmark tool for the .NET framework, written in C#.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/csharpthreadlibrary.htm">PolyThread - C# Threading Library</a></h3>
		<p>A simple and high level job-based threading library for C#. It allows you to define a "job" class and easily execute these "jobs" in parallel. Your client code can be notified when a job is completed through an event, or can call a function that blocks until all jobs are completed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/html-sanitize.htm">Online HTML Sanitize Tool (htmlspecialchars)</a></h3>
		<p>This tool will take your text and convert all the special characters to their proper HTML codes, so you can paste text with special characters or HTML code onto your website.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/textractor.htm">Textractor - Extract Words From Large Files</a></h3>
		<p>This is a command line C# .NET tool for extracting words from large files. It works on Windows with the .NET framework and on Linux with Mono.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/eotp.htm">EOTP - Encrypting One Time Passwords</a></h3>
		<p>One time passwords that provide the server with a static encryption key.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/trustedthirdparty.htm">TRENT - Trusted Random Entropy Generator</a></h3>
		<p>TRENT is a service that allows online contests and drawings to be done securely. TRENT allows both the contest organizer and the contestants to trust the results. Meaning, the organizer knows the random numbers were created using a secure CSPRNG and the contestants know that the organizer did not have any influence over the random numbers.</p>

<h2>What I'm working on right now</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Summer Job</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I plan to do</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>CryptoHost</h3>
		<p>A secure temporary file upload and transfer service.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/passwordbolt.htm">Password Bolt</a></h3>
		<p>An easy to use, open source, web based password manager for the paranoid. Supporting multi-factor authentication, encrypting with three chained block ciphers, using two hash algorithms to generate the key, providing plausible deniability, and using ramtables to store temporary information make it the most "paranoid" password manager ever. It's 99% finished, I just have to package it to make it easier for end-users to install.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="/simppsk.htm">SimpPSK</a></h3>
		<p>SimpPSK is C++ library that allows two parties that share a secret key to communicate securely. It supports cipher and hash algorithm negotiation. Currently it's about 50% complete.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>JavaScript Captcha</h3>
		<p>An effective but simple to use JavaScript captcha that will fall back to a standard image captcha if JavaScript is disabled.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
