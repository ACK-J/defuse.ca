<h1>"Privacy Aware" Unique Hit Counter for PHP</h1>
<p>This PHP class provides a hit counter that is able to count unique hits without directly recording each visitor's IP address. It does so by recording only a cryptographic hash of the IP address and page name. By hashing the IP address with page name as salt, you prevent yourself from being able to track a user as they navigate your site. You also prevent yourself from being able to recover anyone's IP address without brute forcing the 2<sup>32</sup> possible IPv4 addresses, or 2<sup>128</sup> addresses in the case of IPv6.</p>

<p>It is very easy to use. All you need is PHP and a single MySQL database. All the documentation you will need is in the source code file which is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.</p>
