<h1>"Privacy Aware" Unique Hit Counter for PHP</h1>

<p>
This PHP class provides a hit counter that is able to count unique hits without
directly recording each visitor's IP address. It does so by recording only a
cryptographic hash of the IP address and page name. By hashing the IP address
with page name as salt, you prevent yourself from being able to track a user as
they navigate your site. You also prevent yourself from being able to recover
anyone's IP address without brute forcing through all of the assigned IP address
blocks in use by the internet.
</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Optionally ignore hits from search engine spiders and crawlers.</li>
    <li>Optionally ignore hits when the client sends the
        <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Do_not_track">
            Do Not Track</a> header.
    </li>
    <li>IP address ignore list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is very easy to use. All you need is PHP and a single MySQL database. All the
documentation you will need is in the source code file which is licensed under
the GNU GPL v3.
