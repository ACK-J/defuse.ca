<h1>Blowfish Block Cipher</h1>
<p>Blowfish is a secure block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier. It operates on 64 bit blocks and is keyed with a variable key size of 8 to 448 bits. It is a very efficient block cipher, using only 4KB of RAM. Both implementations come with ECB and CBC modes of operation, as well as a built in IV creation system.</p>
