<h2>Skinny Passwords??? Huh???</h2>
<p>Choosing a secure password is really hard. It's always a trade-off between using a strong password and being able to memorize your password. We know that passwords based on dictionary words and common phrases are insecure, so we rely on random password generators to create secure passwords for us.</p>

<p>The most secure kind of passwords are those that are completely random and use both uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. I like to call these <em>fat passwords</em> because they are made up of a random selection of all 94 printable ASCII characters, but they are never very long because few people can memorize long random passwords.</p>

<center>
<p>Example <em>Fat Passwords</em>: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" ><tr><td>$hFW3B^O</td><td>)FcXtz*n</td><td>}Crgc6Kq.YV8</td><td>5N}nn?l@</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>We measure password strength by the number of "guesses" it would take an attacker to figure out the password. Assuming a password is not based on dictionary words, computing it's strength is simple. The formula is: </p>

<center><p style="font-size: large;">&lt;character set size&gt;<sup>&lt;password length&gt;</sup></p></center>

<p>So if the password is randomly chosen from all 94 printable ASCII characters and is 8 characters long, it would take an attacker 94<sup>8</sup> = 6.096Ã—10<sup>15</sup> attempts to have a 100% chance of successfully brute forcing the password.</p>

<p>When &lt;character set size&gt; is large, the password is FAT. When &lt;password length&gt; is large, the password is LONG. Some websites will force you to put symbols and numbers into your password but accept very short passwords. They think that short and fat passwords are more secure than long and skinny passwords. That actually isn't true. Well chosen long and skinny passwords can actually be orders of magnitude more secure than equally memorizable short and fat passwords.</p>

<center>
<p>Example <em>Long Passwords</em>: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" ><tr><td>zzzzzajjj3@jjjjll;;;;;;;;{}{}$zzz</td><td>aaaaa%^^qqquu**0000!hh@</td><td>aaaaaFaaaaa$aaaaaaaG**aaaa</td><td>jj@jjjjj@@j-#hhhwwQQqqQ</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>Of course, when we're choosing passwords that don't have to be memorized by a human, we want them to be as long and fat as possible. When the passwords have to be memorized, it is better to  use long and skinny passwords. By using long and skinny passwords, we obtain a much higher memorability to security ratio.

<h2>Longer, Not Fatter. Why?</h2>
- risks: someone finds out you're using skinny passwords, uses that knowledge to guess other account passwords. use skinny password for a password manager.
- include: cracking power (government, large corporation, basement dweller) as assumptions for password strength calculation
- show an equivalent security full ascii password
- more secure even when we assume the attacker knows we used a shorter character set
- but the attacker really DOESN'T know what subset of the character set we used
- create tool that input: character set subset size, longest allowed run, password length, 
	- shows password security IF: attacker knows the password was generated by this page AND password security if attacker doesn't know the password was generated by this page
	
	- give the user a mnemonic to memorize the password ( e.g. three c's bang bang money six f's money hat)
