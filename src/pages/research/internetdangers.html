<h1>Dangers of the Internet</h1>
<strong>This guide is being actively developed. It is not finished yet, so some pages and important content will be missing.</strong><br /><br />
The internet is useful, but it can also be a very dangerous and damaging place, if you don't know how to use it safely. In this guide, I will teach you - the internet user - how to keep yourself safe online. I will take the time to distinguish between fact and fiction. I won't push unneccessary fear on you. I believe the internet is a good place, we shouldn't be scared to use it. We just need to understand the risks before we can defend ourselves.
