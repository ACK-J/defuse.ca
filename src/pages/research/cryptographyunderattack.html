<h1>Cryptography Under Attack</h1>
Cryptography, once considered a weapon, is a very powerful tool. In our electronic commerce dependant society, it provides digital authentication and confidentiality. It is essential to security and privacy on the internet. You use it everyday, when you purchase an item with a credit card, when you check your email, when you do online banking, and much more.<br /><br />
During the cold war, it was illegal to use strong (unbreakable) cryptography, only weak crypto (which is trivially broken) was allowed. After the threat of the cold war vanished, the governments loosened their restrictions on cryptography. Strong cryptography is now legal to use and export; however, it is once again under attack.<br /><br />
Strong cryptography provides unbreakable security. The governments of leading nations are worried that it allows terrorists to communicate privately, not allowing them to listen in. The FBI has tried multiple times to control strong crypto. Most notably, they suggested that every telecommunication device be required to use an FBI supplied encryption device called the "Clipper Chip". This device would allow anyone sanctioned by the FBI to covertly decrypt the data being transmitted. Another solution to the problem is for the government to have a duplicate of every encryption key that's in use - so they can decrypt anything. The UK took a different approach, if you refuse to give up the password to an encrypted hard drive that could contain incriminating evidence, you go to jail anyway. Law enforcement agencies are in favour of cryptography control, because it would assist in an investigation where, for example, a person is facing charges for the possession of child pornography and the police have no evidence. But they suspect that the images are stored in an encrypted file found on a computer belonging to the accused. Should the government be allowed to have a back door into strong crypto, and all of your private data?<br /><br />
The fundamentals principals of cryptography are secret keys, (passwords) and keeping them secret. As long as these keys are kept private, strong cryptography will remain just that - strong. In any implementation of key escrow, there will be a duplication of keys. Imagine this scenario: You apply for a credit card, you are assigned a 5 digit pin number to prevent credit card fraud. Your registration receipt reads, "Your pin number is 73283," followed by a short description of what a pin number is and why you should keep it private, and to contact the company if anyone else ever figures it out. Directly below the pin, in fine print, it will say "Your pin and credit card number have been forwarded to the Federal Key Management Bureau of America." Now your pin number is in some government database, along with a few million other pin numbers and passwords.<br /><br />
It's easy for one person to keep something secret, remembering a ten character password is easy (for most people). Remembering millions of passwords is next to impossible, so they would have to be stored somewhere. The FKMBA (Federal Key Management Bureau of America), our hypothetical database of pin numbers and passwords, could become a reality if crypto control laws are passed. However, two weeks after this system is put into place, the headline of the New York Times will likely be "FKMBA HACKED - 100K CREDIT CARDS STOLEN". It is a fact that keeping this amount of data (any type of data, not just passwords) secure is impossible. We have seen this over and over again, from Twitter being hacked and thousands of passwords stolen, to the server running studycanada.ca being under the full control of a high school student. A massive database of every encryption key, password, and pin, violates the fundamentals of cryptography. If the government owns your passwords, everyone does.<br /><br />
Other than breaking the fundamental principals of crypto, these laws would be a major breach of privacy for literally everyone. Nobody would be able to communicate without the risk of an authority listening in, and nobody would be able to password protect any documents without someone else being able to open them. All of this for what? What is the benefit? There appears to be only two benefits to using cryptography control. It would allow giant record labels to cooperate with an ISP (Internet Service Provider) to decrypt all of your web traffic to see if you are illegally downloading their songs, so they can fill the courts with millions of lawsuits. The other benefit is being able to force a suspected pedophile or terrorist to decrypt his hard drive in the hopes of finding enough evidence to place charges.<br /><br />
Although well intentioned, this is a very rare occurrence, the most famous being the case, "United States v. Boucher." Boucher was accused of having child pornography on his encrypted laptop. He was unconstitutionally ordered by the judge to decrypt the drive in private so it could be examined. The contents of the drive were never made public. They couldn't charge him with anything because, by giving the password to the laptop, he was incriminating himself, from which he is protected by the United States constitution; designed to protect people from being forced to claim they committed a crime whether or not they committed it. If these laws were in place, an innocent person would be sent to jail if he did not provide a password, and would not be protected by the self incrimination rule if they were guilty and gave up the password. To enter someone's house or seize property, the police need a warrant, to get the password to anyone's encrypted files, all they would need is a badge.<br /><br />
It may reduce the trafficking of illegal digital data, but when considering the enormous amount of violations of privacy these laws will lead to, the benefits certainly do not outweigh the consequences.<br /><br />
Not only are these types of laws immoral, they are technically impossible. A key escrow policy would require every key to be forwarded to the central database, no matter how insignificant it is. In the TLS protocol (the basis of secure communication on the internet), encryption keys are created, used for a few minutes, then destroyed. It would require an immense amount of network traffic to do this, and gigabytes of memory to store the keys so you can present them at the request of the government. There are some forms of crypto that don't rely on keys. Hashes, for example, take a piece of data and generate a small identifier that will match only that piece of data. They are used very commonly used for password validation. According to these proposed laws, the data used to create the identifier hash must also be available to the government. Implementing such a system is downright impossible with our current technology.<br /><br />
Laws requiring a duplicate copy of every encryption key to be sent to a central database, and assigning the power to force anyone to give up their passwords with the threat of jail are ridiculous. Not only are they technically impossible to implement in real life, they are immoral - violating the privacy rights of millions to put one man in a billion behind bars. Keeping the database required by this system secure is also an impossible feat. These laws should never be allowed to pass. Cryptography is much more beneficial to society in its full strength, rather then in a broken state caused by crypto control laws. The implementation of such a system would limit cryptography to the strength of weak crypto, which is easily cracked.<br /><br />
