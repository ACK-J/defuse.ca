<h1>Insane Password Restrictions</h1>

<p>Have you ever noticed that some websites put upper limits on how long passwords are, and what types of characters they can contain? Of course you have, because our <a href="/password-policy-hall-of-shame.htm">password policy statistics</a> page shows that many of the top 100 websites limit passwords to ridiculously short lengths and some even refuse to accept passwords that contain symbols.</p>

<p>Not only do these "insane" password restrictions force users to use weak passwords, but they also have a deeper meaning. If a website puts unreasonable restrictions on how long passwords can be and what characters they contain, it's very likely that <strong>your</strong> passwords are being stored in plain text on the backend, even when we all know that passwords must be <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">hashed with salt</a>. With this page, I hope to clearly explain why this <strong>must</strong> be the case, and what the internet community can do about it.</p>

<p>Let's think about this problem from the perspective of a web application developer. What are passwords? To a web developer, the user's password is nothing more than a regular string of text that's used for authentication. There's no difference between this string of text and any other, except that extra care should be taken to secure the password in the event of a data breach. Other than that, a password is <strong>just text</strong>. But don't web sites handle gigabytes of text each and every day? If they can do that, why can't they accept a measly 15 character password? They will let me use special symbols elsewhere, so why not in my password? Insane password restrictions seem to defy logic.</p>

<div style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Fixed-length database fields.</div>

<p>The database systems that most websites use operate on tables, which are made up of rows and columns. User account data is stored in a table in which every user has one row, and each column contains some information about that user. Here's what a (poorly designed) user account table might look like:</p>

<pre>
        +----------+--------------+------------------+
        | username | password     | email            |
        +----------+--------------+------------------+
        | mike     | letmein1     | mike@example.com |
        | eve      | gB./29M.{q@A | eve@example.com  |
        | joe      | ?joerules!   | joe@example.com  |
        +----------+--------------+------------------+
</pre>

<p>When creating a database table, the developer must specify the maximum amount of characters that can be stored in each field. When the password column's maximum length is set to 20 characters, a 21 character password just won't fit. It's as simple as that. When a website won't accept your ultra-random 64 character password, it's because it won't fit in their database.</p>

<p>That explains the insane length restrictions, but what about when websites don't allow passwords that contain certain symbols?</p>

<div style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Lazy input sanitizing.</div>

<p>Modern database software uses a programming language called SQL to make adding to, removing from, and searching databases easier. An example SQL query, to add a new user account to a table would look something like this:</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT INTO `accounts` (username, email, password) VALUES('mike', 'mike@example.com', 'letmein1');
</p>

<p>Notice how the instructions to the database and the data are all a part of the same blob of text. Some symbols have special meaning to the database software, so if passwords contain any of those symbols, it can mess up the query. For example, if Mike wanted to use "let'me'in" (single quotes between each word) as his password, and this was inserted directly into the SQL query, the database would get something like...</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT INTO `accounts` (username, email, password) VALUES('mike', 'mike@example.com', 'let'me'in');
</p>

<p>... and it would get VERY confused. The single quotes in the password break the quote structure that the database uses to recognize where the password data begins and ends. The database server will reply with something like:</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'me'in')' at line 1
</p>

<p>The <strong>incorrect</strong> solution to this problem is to disallow the use of single quotes in passwords or just strip them out. Most database systems provide a function that will escape the special characters, turning ' (single quote) into \' (backslash, single quote), to tell the database that we want the actual character, not the special meaning it has to the database. Good programmers will use those functions, bad programmers will strip out the special characters or disallow them by policy. </p>

<h2>The Right Way to Store Passwords</h2>
<p>There's a <strong>REALLY SIMPLE</strong> solution to both the problem of not being able to fit long passwords in the database, and the problem of not being able to have special symbols in the data being sent to the database. The solution is password <strong>hashing</strong>.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions are a special type of cryptographic function that will take absolutely any amount of input, and "hash" it down to a fixed-length, short, crypto-token that is, for all purposes, a unique signature of the input. Let's look at some examples:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" style="font-family: monospace;">
<tr>
    <th>Data</th>
    <th>SHA256 Hash</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>"Hello World!"</td>
    <td>7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>"Hello World?"</td>
    <td>8a0b7c6635f51f10710decaa6fd58fdd9fa3a5aae4df8a96f949fea7cf614970</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>"kzpdhr@'rL3"</td>
    <td>d2c934ec66c6416c1bbcd6e2876bb5fac92641855f05056f22b611815c690910</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>"#Ozd7ZQv7&lt;Wkf3.?jFe7}7zn9N7aQlK?%?Nx+|(&gt;^~IOdz%L&amp;gGor^PiP{5|Qzc-"</td>
    <td>ed6b449328a929e858895668605220ed1253c4a947db0d6fed9cbaec357acac0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>My entire hard drive.</td>
    <td>b976b0674e9f7104db6bc313eb48f9b99f35ae875500f9c9d33b8397e86a6048</td>
</tr>

<p>There are five properties of hash functions that are important when talking about password hashing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hash functions will accept any amount of input.</li>
    <li>Hash functions will accept any type of data: English text, text with special symbols, and even binary data.</li>
    <li>The output of a hash function will always be the same length no matter how large of an input was used.</li>
    <li>It's <strong>VERY</strong> hard to find two inputs that result in the same hash.</li>
    <li>It's impossible to recover the input from the hash value.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to <strong>EASILY</strong> solve both of the problems discussed earlier, all we have to do is hash the passwords before we put them in the database. Since they'll accept any amount of input, we don't have to worry about how long the passwords are or what characters they contain. A database that contains hashed passwords will look something like:</p>

<pre>
        +----------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
        | username | password-hash                            | email            |
        +----------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
        | mike     | d04c1675b232c6ece69ed95e189e95d589f217b0 | mike@example.com |
        | eve      | 15d028159282891c5091742b64ed99f2269234d0 | eve@example.com  |
        | joe      | 8bd33501ae5758349510c93a8d086d4b322ecf03 | joe@example.com  |
        +----------+------------------------------------------+------------------+
</pre>

<p>Now...</p>

<ul>
    <li>We can accept passwords of any length.</li>
    <li>We can accept passwords with any types of characters (even Chinese!).</li>
    <li>If a cyber-criminal hacks into the web server, they don't get the passwords, only the hashes, which are useless to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hashing passwords is incredibly easy. Almost <strong>ALL</strong> web programming languages have cryptographic hash functions built into their standard library, and free code exists on the internet for any languages that don't. I'll show you, in PHP code, how easy it is to hash passwords.</p>

<p style="background-color: #faffb2; padding:5px; border: solid black 1px;"><strong>IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE</strong>: If you're going to be implementing a password hashing scheme, please refer to my <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">password hashing page on CrackStation.net</a> because there are a few very important, but very simple, things that you have to do to ensure that the hashes in your database are exceptionally hard to crack.</p>

<h3>Plain Text Login System</h3>

<pre style="background-color: black; color: silver; padding: 5px; border: solid #606060 3px;">
// ====== Adding an account ======
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$password = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);

if(strlen($password) &gt; 20)
{
    die("Sorry, your password is too long!");
}

mysql_query("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES('$username', '$password')");

// ====== Verifying an account ======
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$password = $_POST['username'];
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'");
$result = mysql_fetch_array($result);

if($password === $result['password'])
{
    // The password is correct...
}
else
{
    // The password is not correct...
}
</pre>

<h3>Hashed Password Login System</h3>

<pre style="background-color: black; color: silver; padding: 5px; border: solid #606060 3px;">
// ====== Adding an account =====.
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$password = $_POST['username'];

<span style="color:red;">$salt = bin2hex(mycrypt_create_iv(16));
$password_hash = hash("SHA256", $salt . $password);</span>

mysql_query("INSERT INTO users (username, password-hash, salt) " . 
                "VALUES('$username', '$password_hash', '$salt')");

// ====== Verifying an account ======
$username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$password = $_POST['username'];
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'");
$result = mysql_fetch_array($result);

<span style="color:red;">if(hash("SHA256", $result['salt'] . $password) === $result['password-hash'])</span>
{
    // The password is correct...
}
else
{
    // The password is not correct...
}
</pre>

<p>The difference between a plain text login system and one that hashes password properly is <strong>only THREE LINES OF CODE!</strong>. It really is <strong>INCREDIBLY EASY</strong> to implement secure password hashing. There's absolutely no downside to hashing passwords, and <strong>absolutely no reason not to do it</strong>.</p>

<h2>Putting the Pieces Together</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Password hashing is <strong>super easy</strong> to implement.</li>
    <li>There are no disadvantages to hashing passwords, only benefits.</li>
    <li>When passwords are being hashed, there is <strong>no reason</strong> to limit passwords to a short length or restrict the use of symbols.</li>
    <li>Nothing is done without reason.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, if a website imposes unreasonable limits on password length or restricts the use of some types of characters, it's <strong>very likely</strong> that their users' passwords are being stored in plain text.</p>

<!-- TODO: Relate statistics in here, deduce how many passwords are being stored in plaintext -->

<h2>Why Storing Passwords in Plain Text is Bad</h2>

<h3>To Web Developers</h3>

<h3>To Users</h3>

<p>Storing passwords in plain text is, without a doubt, one of the largest security problems internet users face today. When you run a website that stores passwords in plain text, you're pretty much asking to be hacked.</p>

<p>When (not if) you get hacked, the passwords of every single one of your users will be released into the hands of cyber-criminals. From there they will be sold, traded, and distributed throughout the underground security scene until they are put to use. The average internet user uses the same password on every website they visit, so it's no suprise that cyber-criminals will try to use the passwords gathered from hacked databases to access those accounts. By storing passwords in plain text, you leave your users vulnerable to a threat that is easily thrwarted with password hashing.</p>

<p>These kinds of breaches are <strong>not science fiction</strong>. They happen every day to companies big and small. A real world example is the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217273/Sony_Pictures_falls_victim_to_major_data_breach">Sony Pictures breach</a>, in which <a href="https://twitter.com/LulzSec">LulzSec</a> discovered that all 1,000,000 passwords were accessible through a simple SQL injection hack.</p>

<!-- TODO: More examples -->

<p>To summarize, by not hashing passwords...</p>

<ul>
    <li>You give cyber-criminals motivation to break into your systems.</li>
    <li>You put your users at great risk.</li>
    <li>You portray an image of irresponsibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've shown that it only takes <strong>three</strong> extra lines of code to implement hashing. If you're not hashing your user's passwords, you should not be asking for them in the first place.</p>

<h2>A Call to Action</h2>
TODO.
<!--
--we're getting SSL, now this is the next step
-- calculate storate space saved by having passwords shorter (show there's no benefit)


-- suppport so it can be read

-- if the password is stored in plaintext, there must be an upper limit on length
-- if the password was being hashed, there doesn't need to be an upper limit on length
-- No sane developer would intentionally design-in INsecurity
therefore: If the password is restricted to an UNREASONABLE maximum length, it's probably that it's stored in plaintext.
--- GOOD: even when the database is EXTREMELY limited, it's possible to construct a hash that will fit those parameters. so even old old database systems can use hashing

-- add being able to accept chinese characters should motivate higher ups-->
