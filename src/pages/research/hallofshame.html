<span style="font-size: 20px;">Storing passwords in PLAIN TEXT is <span style="color:red;"><b>NOT SAFE</b></span>.</span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 20px;">It's time to make online services clean up their act!</span>
</div>
<p>This is a user-submitted list of websites and services that enforce any password policy restrictions that are detrimental to password security. This includes password policies that exclude special characters or enforce a maximum length. These unreasonable password policies are signs that the passwords are being stored in <b>plain text</b>, not <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">hashed with salt</a>.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions will take <b>any input</b> and produce a fixed-length cryptographic signature of the input. If the passwords are being hashed, there is no need for password restrictions, so we can assume any websites that impose these restrictions are storing passwords in plain text...until they prove otherwise.</p>

<p>There are two sections in this list. The first contains websites and services that are imposing unreasonable restrictions and <b>may</b> be storing the passwords in plain text. The second is a list of websites that impose unreasonable restrictions but have proven to us that the passwords are being hashed properly.</p>

<h2>How to Submit</h2>

<p>You can find my email address on the <a href="/contact.htm">contact page</a>. Send me: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The name (and division) of the company, service, or website</li>
	<li>An explaination of the unreasonable restrictions they are imposing</li>
	<li>A link to a page on their website where I can verify your claims</li>
</ul>
<p>We will contact the service in question and give them one week to explain their behaviour. If they do not reply, are not hashing the passwords, or cannot explain the restrictions, they will be added to to the list until they clean up their act.</p>
<h2>How do I get my company/website off the list?</h2>
<p>To get your company or website's name off this list, you must remove the password restrictions in question or give us a good reason why you cannot remove them. You also have to clearly describe to us HOW your passwords are being stored in your database. We will work with you to verify the facts, and will remove you from the list promptly. We will not comply with takedown notices.
