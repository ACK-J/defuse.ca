<span style="font-size: 20px;">Storing passwords in PLAIN TEXT is <span style="color:red;"><b>NOT SAFE</b></span>.</span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 20px;">It's time to make online services clean up their act!</span>
</div>
<p>This is a user-submitted list of websites and services that enforce any password policy restrictions that are detrimental to password security. This includes password policies that exclude special characters or enforce a maximum length. These unreasonable password policies are signs that the passwords are being stored in <b>plain text</b>, not <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">hashed with salt</a>.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions will take <b>any input</b> and produce a fixed-length cryptographic signature of the input. If the passwords are being hashed, there is no need for password restrictions, so we can assume any websites that impose these restrictions are storing passwords in plain text...until they prove otherwise.</p>

<p>There are three sections in this list. The first contains websites and services that are imposing unreasonable restrictions and <b>may</b> be storing the passwords in plain text. The second is a list of websites that accept long passwords without error but only validate the first few characters. The third is a list of websites that impose unreasonable restrictions but have proven to us that the passwords are being hashed properly.</p>
