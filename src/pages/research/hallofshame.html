<span style="font-size: 20px;">Storing passwords in PLAIN TEXT is <span style="color:red;"><b>NOT SAFE</b></span>.</span>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 20px;">It's time to make online services clean up their act!</span>
</div>
<p>This is a user-submitted list of websites and services that enforce a password policy that is detrimental to password security. This includes password policies that exclude special characters or enforce a maximum length. These unreasonable password policies are signs that the passwords are being stored in <b>plain text</b>, not <a href="http://crackstation.net/hashing-security.html">hashed with salt</a>.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions will take <b>any input</b> and produce a fixed-length cryptographic signature of the input. If the passwords are being hashed, there is no need for password restrictions, so we can assume any websites that impose these restrictions are storing passwords in plain text...until they prove otherwise.</p>

<h2>How to Help</h2>
<p>If you use one of these services, please write to them. Ask them to remove the password restrictions and ensure that they are hashing the passwords properly. Encouraging your friends to do the same, and sharing this page will help too. These are big companies; they won't change anything unless we work together to apply pressure.</p>
