<h1>Economic DDoS - A Theoretical Attack on BitCoin</h1>
<p>May 1st, 2011</p>
<p>
Here I will describe how, theoretically, a state-sponsored or corporation-sponsored attack could destroy the BitCoin economy. It's obvious that it's possible by outlawing all BitCoin-related software; this attack takes a different approach, accomplishing the same goals quickly and covertly.

Before starting, I would like to make it very clear that this attack is <strong>theoretical</strong> and does NOT pose an immediate threat to users of BitCoin or the value of the BitCoin currency. Furthermore, it does not allow the theft of BitCoins or duplicate payments, it simply provides a process a wealthy nation could follow to dramatically decrease the value of a BitCoin. Do not let this deter you from downloading and using BitCoin. It is a truly innovative and well-designed system.

There are only a handful of online BitCoin exchange services. These exchange services can provide USD to BitCoin and BitCoin to USD exchanges by keeping a reserve fund in both currencies. When a customer wants to convert $10 USD to BitCoin, they add his $10 to their USD reserve, and pull money from their BitCoin reserve to pay back the customer. To convert 10 BTC to USD, they add the 10 BTC to their BitCoin reserve, and give the customer money from their USD reserve. These systems set their exchange rates so that the amount of BitCoin being converted to Dollars is the same as the amount of Dollars being Converted to BitCoin - so they always have money in both reserves.
