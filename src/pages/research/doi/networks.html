<h2>WiFi HotSpots</h2>
It's a great convenience that free wireless internet access is available in many public places. It's becoming increasingly more common for coffee shops and restaraunts to provide free wifi so their customers can be connected while eating. Although this is really useful, there are some major security problems for the users of these "open" networks.
<br /><br />
Most people don't realize that when they are connected to an open WiFi network, their traffic is being broadcast to everyone else. WiFi is radio, all of the data being sent between your computer and the wireless access point is sent through the air, just like a radio station broadcasting music. This means that ANYONE in the area can listen in on the connections between your computer and the websites that you're browsing. This means they can see the contents of every webpage you visit, and even see your passwords as you login to your accounts. 
<br /><br />
You may think that there is very little risk here, because the bad guy would have to be physically close to you. But that isn't the case. It's SO easy to take advantage of someone using open WiFi that even my grandmother could do it. There are freely available tools that make it easy for anyone to sniff your wireless signal out of the air, and login to your accounts with only a few clicks.
