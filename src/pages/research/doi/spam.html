<h2>Email Scams</h2>
The best way to introduce email scams is with an example. Here is an email from my junk folder.
<blockquote style="border: solid blue 1px; padding:5px; background-color:#ddffff;">
<div style="border:solid blue 1px; background-color: #66ccdd"><b>From: Hazzan Mohamadou (humohammadou@one.co.il)</b></div>

This is a classic scam. As you can see, they usually involve a large amount of money that they are unable to access, and they want to give it to you. This is obviously too good to be true.
<br /><br />
Another similar example, also from my junk folder:
<blockquote style="border: solid blue 1px; padding:5px; background-color:#ddffff;">

<br />

<br />

<br />
THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND AN INDIGINE OF MY COUNTRY BURKINABEÃ‰ ( BURKINA FASO ) CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.<br />

If you reply to an email like this, they will keep in touch with you and try to gain your trust. They try to become one of your freinds. They do this so that when they ask you for a bit of money, you won't think twice about sending it to them. They might start with small requests like having you send pictures of yourself, then they might ask for a small amount of money, something like $10. When you send the money, they know they have your trust, and they will start increasing the amount of money they need. Using different social engineering techniques, they can hook you into sending them money for years. For some people who have fallen into these traps, the bond between scammer and victim becomes so strong that they can't break contact even when they know it's a scam.
<br /><br />
It may seem obvious to you that this example email is a scam, but emails like these costed businesses in the United States on the order of $100 billion in 2007. Suprisingly, some people actually believe these obviously bogus emails. Even if only 0.1% of people fall for these scams, if the spammers can send them to millions of people, 1000 people will fall for them. 

<br /><br />
Some scam emails can actually be pretty convincing. If they say one of their loved ones are dying and they need money to pay hospital fees, don't worry. You don't need to send money. Nobody is dying, it's just another social engineering technique. However, if any email ever makes a threat to your life, or a loved ones life, bring it to your local police. They may also use some of your personal information or family history to pursuade you to reply. They want to get you to think they know you or a family member personally, but they really don't. They got the information about you by searching your name, looking up genealogy records, and finding other information about you on the internet.
<br /><br />
If you believe you are becoming a victim of one of these scams, <b>STOP ALL CONTACT</b> with the scammers. Don't reply to emails, and don't answer phone calls. Don't even send them a good bye message. No matter what they do, even if they say their lives are in danger, NEVER reply.
<br /><br />
The best way to protect yourself is to <b>never reply</b> to these emails, and <b>never click links</b> in the emails. Never trust anything an email tells you. If you are not sure if it's a scam, just <b>delete it</b>.

Here are some more examples to help you recognize a scam:<br />
<blockquote style="border: solid blue 1px; padding:5px; background-color:#ddffff;">
<div style="border:solid blue 1px; background-color: #66ccdd"><b>From: "amanda" &lt;thomas@hotreel.com&gt;</b></div> 
<br />
How are you doing today. I hope that you are sitting down because I found that site that you couldn't find. I almost gave up but luckily I did find it so here you go hxxp://quantumcreditrepair.com/49r9==siRd$ss0,szdps/. I almost forgot, I looked at it and it is something that you should look at and it will help you right now and they do not want any money to get your problems eliminated, and not only that if you do not like what you see while you are there just say so and you will never bothered by them again. 
<br /><br />
<div style="border:solid blue 1px; background-color: #66FFCC">The correct response to this email is to delete it. Do NOT visit the website under any circumstances. The email says to open the website to make them stop spamming you, but this only lets them know that there is a real person behind your address, so they will send you more spam.</div>

<h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
A "Phishing Attack" is when a bad guy sends you something such as a link or email, that looks like it comes from a legitimate service. For example, they may send you an email claming to be your bank and say that your account has been hacked and you must change your password. They would include a link to a website that looks a lot like your real bank, but it's set up to steal your password. Phishing attacks are very hard to spot if you don't know what to look for.
<center><img src="images/paypalphish.png" width="700px" /><br />This website looks like PayPal, but it's really a phishing site designed to <b>steal your password.</b></center>
<br />
Phishing websites can <b>look exactly the same as the real thing</b>, so it's important to be able to distinguish from a phishing site and the real thing. When you want to know if a website is real or fake, look at the URL. Here are some examples of what the bad guys will do to try to make the URL look like the real thing:<br /><br />
<center>
<table style="background-color:#ddffff; font-weight:bold;" cellpadding=10 >
<tr><th><center>Fake</center></th><th><center>Real</center></th></tr>
<tr><td style="background-color: #FFCCCC;">http://www.go0gle.com/login.asp?p=23822020</td><td style="background-color: #CCFFCC;">https://www.google.com/accounts/</td></tr>
<tr><td style="background-color: #FFCCCC;">http://www.youtube.com.watch.ly?v=zxkjayjs</td><td style="background-color: #CCFFCC;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg</td></tr>
<tr><td style="background-color: #FFCCCC;">http://faceboook.com</td><td style="background-color: #CCFFCC;">http://facebook.com</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Before giving a website any sort of information, ALWAYS verify that the domain name in the URL EXACTLY MATCHES the domain for the website you think you are on. When you verify that a URL matches, make sure you look at what is in your browser's URL bar (at the very top). Don't just look at the link you click on. For example <a href="http://youtube.com">http://google.com</a> looks like it's a valid google URL, but the link really points to http://youtube.com. The best way to be sure you're on the right website is to manually type the URL to the real website, and find the page in question from the real site's homepage. If you can't get to it from the real website, it's probably a phishing attack.
<br /><br />
Here is a breakdown of a URL to help you distinguish between real and fake:<br /><br />
<div style="font-size:20pt"><center><span style="color:blue">http://</span><span style="color:green;">bin.</span><span style="color:red;">ossbox.com</span><span style="color:black;">/</span><span style="color:green;">view.php?h=sjQEz</span></center></div>
<h3 style="color:blue;">http://</h3>
This part of the URL specifies what protocol to use. You may have seen http://, https:// and ftp://. This part of the url tells the computer how to communicate with the website.
<h3 style="color:red;">ossbox.com</h3>
This is called the domain name. This is the part of the URL that you need to check. This part tells the computer what website to visit. 
<br /><br />
There are two parts of the domain name. In this example there is "ossbox" and ".com". When you are checking if a url is valid, it's important that both of these are the same as the real website. For example, "ossbox.co.uk", "ossbox.com.ru", "ossbox.com.id.ly" are NOT the same website as "ossbox.com".
<h3 style="color:green;">bin.</h3>
Anything that comes before the domain name is called a subdomain. Like the domain name, this also tells the computer what website to visit, but it's common for websites to have many different subdomains. For example, <a href="http://bin.ossbox.com">http://bin.ossbox.com</a> and <a href="http://ossbox.com/">http://ossbox.com</a> are both the OSSBox website. The subdomain "bin." tells the web browser to visit our secure pastebin page instead of the homepage. When checking the validity of a URL, it is ok for the subdomain vary, as long as the domain name it comes before points to the correct website.
<br /><br />
A common technique the bad guys use is to create a subdomain that looks like the real website's domain. For example, in the URL "http://paypal.com.badsite.com" the domain is NOT paypal.com, it's badsite.com.

<h3 style="color:black;">/<span style="color:green">view.php?h=sjQEz</span></h3>
This slash separates the subdomains and the domain name from the rest of the URL. Anything after this first slash just tells the website what page you want to see. When you're checking a URL you can ignore everything after the first slash. For example, "http://my.ly/youtube.com" is NOT "youtube.com", it is really "my.ly".
<br /><br />

<h2>Email Phishing</h2>
Email Phishing is the exact same thing as website phishing, except with emails instead of websites. The bad guys will send millions of emails that look a lot like they came from a real bank. Because email provides no authentication, they can make it look EXACTLY like a real bank email, even the "from" address will be the same. So when you get an email that claims to be from a bank or other important website, you have to be very careful.
<br /><br />
For example, take a look at this email that appears to be from CitiBank:<br /><br />
<center><img src="images/phishing-email.jpg" alt="Phishing Email Example" /></center>
<br /><br />
The text in the image says:<br />
<blockquote style="border: solid blue 1px; padding:5px; background-color:#ddffff;">
<div style="border:solid blue 1px; background-color: #66ccdd"><b>From: alerts [alerts@citibank.com]</b></div> 
<br />

</blockquote>
Would you beleive an email like this? Most people would say yes. This goes to show how powerful and dangerous email phishing attacks are. The email looks like it comes from a real citibank address, and looks very professional. The content of the email is actually very beleivable.
<br /><br />
The truth is that this email is a phishing attack. If you were to click the link in that email, it would take you to a fake citibank phishing website, where it would ask for your password, and now the bad guys have access to all of your money.
<br /><br />
Don't rely on the "From" address in an email to know who it's really from. It's super easy to send an email with any "From" address that you want. I could send you an email from president@usa.gov if i wanted to. So how can you tell if an email is real or not? You simply can't. What you should do, instead of clicking the link in the email is go to the real citibank (or your bank's) website, citibank.com, and login there. If there is anything your bank needs you to do, you will be asked to do it from the real website, not from an email.
<br /><br />
<b>Remeber:</b> NEVER clicks links in any email. ALWAYS go directly to the real website by typing the URL into your web browser.
