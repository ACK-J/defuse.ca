<h1>Viruses, Worms, and Exploits - Rooting Your Box</h1>
<strong>This guide is being actively developed. It is not finished yet, so some pages and important content will be missing.</strong><br /><br />
"Rooting a box" is a term used by hackers that means they have gained control over your computer. The term "root" comes from the name of the user account on a Unix system that has the privelige to do anything - delete files, change passwords, anything. If a bad guy "roots" your box, it means they can now make your computer do anything they want. They can make it record every key you press to steal your passwords, and they can make YOUR computer attack websites that the bad guys have been hired to take down. Even worse, bad guys can create malware that does this for them, automatically.

<h2>What is Malware?</h2>
Malware is a type of computer program that is designed to control your computer without you knowing it. In the same way as we get sick with the cold, computers get infected with malware. Once your computer gets infected, it can infect other computers. Once malware is on your computer, it lets bad guys control it from anywhere in the world. They can spy on everything you do, steal your most private data, and scare you into giving them money.

<h2>Types of Malware</h2>
There are many different ways to classify malware. They are classified by the way they infect your computer, and the things they do once they are in control. Here are the ones you need to know about.
<h3>Trojan Horses</h3>
Trojan horses are programs that look like a real program, but have malware attached to them. They convice you that they are something useful, and you willingly download them. Trojan Horse viruses can be attached to any kind of computer program. It is very common for them to be attached warez (software piracy) tools, like keygens and cracks, downloadable games, and freeware programs. It is even possible that trojan horses can be attached to well known programs available from third party websites. That's why it's VERY important to make sure that you trust the software you download, and that you're getting your software from the original developers.

<h3>Worms</h3>
Worms are viruses that try to infect other computers.  Worms infect as many computers as possible, and they create a massive network that a bad guy can control. Worms are especially dangerous because they can infect your computer without needing you to download and run a program. They spread and infect computers completely automatically. They scan the internet for other computers that are vulnerable to exploits, and infect them. These networks of infected computers are called "botnets" and they can be up to millions of computers in size. The bad guys can use these networks of infected computers to send spam, or to send massive amounts of network traffic to a website, more than it can handle, effectively taking it offline.

<h3>Scareware</h3>
Scareware is a form of malware designed to scare you. Scareware commonly opens a window on your computer and claims your computer is infected with viruses, and that you need to buy a program to get rid of them. These fake antivirus programs are the virus themselves. Never give in to any program that demands that you buy a license or pay to activate a feature. Of course, there are valid programs that require you to buy a license before you can use it, but normally you would have remembered installing that program. Don't let the user interface of these scareware applications fool you, they are designed to look a lot like features in windows and real antivirus programs. They will use the same window style, and even the same logo as the real thing.

<h3>Spyware</h3>
Spyware is a class of malware that is used to spy on you. Sometimes they will record everything you type and post it on the internet. The bad guys can then review theys "key logs" and extract your passwords and credit card information. Other forms of spyware will keep track of websites you visit, and send this information to advertising agencies. These usually show up as web browser toolbars that offer "animated smileys", search toolbars, stylized cursors, and screensavers.

<h2>Exploits &amp; Spreading - How the Malware Gets In</h2>
The creators of malware want it to infect as many computers as possible. There are many ways that malware can infect other computers. Some require you to download and open a file, while some can infect your system without needing you to do anything at all.
<h3>Email Attachments</h3>
Some worms spread by email. Once they infect your machine, they send themselves to everyone in your mail reader's contact list. These worms are especially effective because people inherently trust files being sent from a freind. To protect yourself from these worms, NEVER open any dangerous files sent to you through email. What constitues a dangerous file is discussed below. If you absolutely have to open an attachment, make sure that the person it's from actually sent it. Also, don't click links in email, even links to good websites. A maliciously crafed email could make a link look like "google.com" but really takes you to website that infects your computer using a drive-by download attack (discussed below).
<br /><br />
<b>Dangerous file types:</b><br />
<br />
Never open any of these file types unless you trust them 100%. This is just a short list, there are ways malware can infect you by opening a word document (.doc) file and even an image (.jpg) file, so it's best to not open any attachments at all.

<tr><th>Extension</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>.exe, .scr, .sct, .com, .bat, .cmd</td><td>An executable program. NEVER let anyone send you this type of file, if it is malicious, it can easily obtain full control over your system once you open it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>.vb, .vbe, .vbs, .js</td><td>A BASIC/JavaScript script file. Allows code execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>.reg</td><td>Changes windows registry values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>.url</td><td>Can send you to an unexpected website</td></tr>
<tr><td>.pdf</td><td>Portable Document Format. Commonly used to send documents, but exploits in Adobe Reader can allow PDF files to execute code on your system.</td></tr>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you want to see file extensions in Windows Explorer, open "My Computer", click "Tools" then "Folder Options...", then on the "View" tab, <b>uncheck</b> "Hide extensions for known file types".
<h3>Software Exploits</h3>
<h3>Drive-By Downloads</h3>
It may be hard to believe, but sometimes you can get infected by a virus just by visiting a website. What happens is, the website sends your browser a web page that contains an exploit. Somtimes the programmers of web browsers and their plugins make a mistake that allows a website to execute real machine code when the browser displays the page. These exploits are commonly found in browser plugins such as Flash and Java and Adobe Acrobat, but sometimes the web browser itsself is exploitable in this way. Spammers send links to these drive-by download sites to millions of people, and when those people click the link, their computers become part of a botnet.
<br /><br />
First and foremost, NEVER click a link in email. Your best defense from these kinds of attacks is to keep your software updated. Keep your web browser, and all of it's plugins up to date. You may even want to use alternative software that will resist these attacks simply because the attacks were not designed for them. For example, use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer, and use Foxit instead of Adobe Reader. On top of that, only visit websites you know and trust. 
<br /><br />
Sometimes the bad guys can put these drive-by download exploits on popular websites, so there is still a small risk of being exploited when you only visit websites you trust. If you worry about that happening, I highly reccomend using Firefox with the NoScript add-on. NoScript allows you to selectivly disable JavaScript. JavaScript is required for most exploits to work, so disabling it will greatly increase your security.
