<h1>Information &amp; Password Security</h1>
<strong>This guide is being actively developed. It is not finished yet, so some pages and important content will be missing.</strong><br /><br />
It's nearly impossible to use the internet without having to create an account for some service. In this section we look at why it's important to use different passwords for every website, and why you should be very careful about what information you give to websites, even if you trust them.

<h2>Protect Your Information</h2>
When you browse the web, buy things online, and create user accounts on websites, you are giving away personal data. When you buy something from an online store, using your credit card, that website can store your credit card information in it's database. When you register for an account on a website, the website saves your password in the website's database. We would like to think that these websites will keep our data save, but this is rarely ever the case.
<br /><br />
If the websites you use don't protect your data, the bad guys can break in and steal it. You can never tell if a website is even implementing basic security measures to protect your data, so it's your responsibility to restrict the amount of information that you share with websites.
<br /><br />
When the bad guys break into a website, they can steal the whole database, which contains all of the personal information for everyone using that website. If the website is an online store, the bad guys can easily get, on the order of 100,000, credit card numbers and their related information. Once they hack a few websites, they sell these lists by the million. The buyers of these lists can then use your credit card to buy anything they want. The best solution to this is to use something like <a href="https://paypal.com/">PayPal</a> to buy things online, instead of giving every online store your credit card info.
<br /><br />
Whenever you sign up for a website with an email address and a password, this information gets stored in a database. The bad guys can steal this information just as easily. As with credit card information, they sell lists of login information by the million. With these lists, there are a few things the bad guys can do. First, they can login to your account on that website and impersonate you. Second, even more troubling, they can see if the password for your bank website is the same password you used for the hacked website. This gives them access to ALL of your accounts, if you use the same password for each one.
<br /><br />
You have no way of controling what the websites you use do with your data. To protect yourself, only give your credit card information (and any other personal information) to reputable websites, and use a different password for every website. This way, if a website gets hacked and the bad guys get your password, they won't be able to use it to log on to your accounts on other websites.

<h2>Choosing Good Passwords</h2>
We know that we have to use strong passwords, and use different passwords for every website. This can be hard because strong passwords are hard to remember, and remembering a strong password for every website is even harder. First, we will look at how to make strong passwords, secondly we will look at how to save many different passwords properly.
<br /><br />
<h3>Strong Passwords</h3>
Password strength is a function of how long the password is, and how many different characters it contains. This means that we want a long password, that has both lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
<br /><br />
Good passwords look like this:<br />
<ul>
	<li>]IhPXa/7dV</li>
	<li>uZ-EVt9&lt;</li>
	<li>xEDexB6niM;</li>
</ul>
<br />
As a general rule, your passwords should be:
<ul>
	<li>At least 8 characters long.</li>
	<li>Contain a letter, number, and symbol.</li>
	<li>Not created from any word (e.g. "P@$Sw0Rd").</li>
</ul>
<br />
To create these passwords, you can come up with your own, but the best way is to use a random password generator. One really good password generator is the <a href="http://grc.com/passwords" target="_blank">GRC Perfect Password</a> Generator. Of course you shouldn't trust just any website to generate your passwords for you, but GRC is very reputable so there is no harm in bookmarking that page and using it to generate passwords.
<br /><br />
If you don't want to use random passwords, come up with your own method of creating a unique password for the website you're on. For example, take the domain name of the website (e.g. paypal.com) and mix in your birth year or SSN in a random way. Then change some of the lowercase letters to uppercase. So you end up with something like "p576Ay19P58al". Make sure that whatever you do isn't predictable or obvious. Once you come up with your password generating algorithm, you can apply it to other domain names, so that you have a different password for every website.
<h3>How "strong" are good passwords?</h3>
To measure how strong a password is, we can estimate how long it would take a computer to guess the password. We use computers to guess passwords because they are very fast. Desktop computers can guess millions of passwords per second, more expensive computers can reach speeds of trillions of passwords per second. If your password is just a word, to guess your password, all the computer has to do is try every word. If we assume that there are 4 million words, it would take a computer only a few seconds to guess your password. This is why it is important that your password isn't based on a word. Even if you make a change to the word, for example, changing "password" into "P@S$w0rd" is still a bad way to create a password. Changing letters into numbers and adding numbers on to the end make the password a bit stronger, but computers will be able to guess it in a few hours.
<br /><br />
The best passwords are random passwords. They aren't made from any words, they are made from random data. As a result, they are very hard to remember, but much stronger. Computers can't use lists of words to help them guess random passwords, so they have to try every possible combination of characters. For example, computers will try to guess an 8 character password made up of letters, like this:
<br />
<pre>
aaaaaaaa
baaaaaaa
caaaaaaa
daaaaaaa
eaaaaaaa
faaaaaaa
gaaaaaaa
haaaaaaa
....
</pre>
It's counting through every possible combination. Eventually it will reach the end:
<br />
<pre>
xzzzzzzz
yzzzzzzz
zzzzzzzz
</pre>
If your password was "zheljskz" somewhere between the begining and the end, it would have guessed your password. This method of guessing is called brute force.
<br />
The number of possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols in an 8 character password (using letters only) is calculated with the formula: <strong>26<sup>8</sup></strong> (The number of possible characters in the passwords to the power of the length of the password). We want this number to be as high as possible, to give even the fastest computers a hard time guessing it. In the following table, you will see why using every type of character (letters, numbers, and symbols) in your passwords and using long passwords, are important. For every character you add, you are making your password many times stronger.
<br /><br />
<table border=1 >
<tr><th>Characters</th><th>Length</th><th># Possibilities</th><th>Time to Guess*</th></tr>
<tr><td>Lowercase letters</td><td>6</td><td>308,915,776</td><td>3 Minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lowercase letters and numbers</td><td>6</td><td>2,176,782,336</td><td>15 Minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Uppercase, lowercase, and numbers</td><td>8</td><td>218,340,105,584,896</td><td>4 Years</td></tr>
<tr><td>Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols</td><td>8</td><td>6,095,689,385,410,816</td><td>100 Years</td></tr>
</table>

Here is a graph to help you visualize why using a longer password is much more secure:

<h3>Do I really need passwords this strong?</h3>
Yes, if you're password is shorter than 8 characters or is based on a word, it can be guessed in a few days. You have to decide if the information the password is protecting is worth using a stronger password. It's probably ok to use strong passwords for important things, like your bank website and email accounts, and weaker passwords for not-so-important websites. But always remember to use different passwords for different websites.
<br /><br />
With a much more expensive computer, all of these passwords could be brute forced in a few days, but we don't need to worry about that for website passwords. The bad guys don't  have access to an expensive supercomputer, and they don't want to wait 100 years to crack into your account. However, passwords being used for any type of encryption should be at least 20 characters long. This is because encrypted data is usually more important, and the bad guys will put more effort into cracking it.
<h3>How do I remember a different password for every website?!?</h3>
It's important to have a different password for every website, but nobody wants to remember 10 of these random passwords. Before I go on to mention the "best" solution to remembering passwords, I'll offer a simple solution that should work for everyone: Write your passwords on two peices of paper. Keep one in your wallet and one at home in case you lose your wallet. That should be secure enough for most people, but if you want military grade encryption to keep your passwords safe, read on..
<br /><br />
The best solution is to use a password manager, a safe place to keep all of your passwords. When you use a password manager, you will only have to remember one password. All of your other passwords will be encrypted with your "master" password, and kept safe. Whenever you need one of your passwords, just open up your password manager.
<br /><br />
A very good password manager is <a href="http://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>. It uses state of the art encryption to ensure that even the LastPass staff won't be able to see your passwords. LastPass will let you store as many passwords as you want, and they will be accesible from anywhere you can get internet access. They even have an iPhone app. If you want more information about LastPass security, listen to the <a href="http://media.grc.com/sn/sn-256.mp3">LastPass review on the SecurityNow! podcast</a>.
<br /><br />
If you want something even more secure, and you know how to setup a website and don't mind getting your hands dirty setting it up, check out my password manager, <a href="http://ossbox.com/index.php?page=passwordbolt">Password Bolt</a>.
<br /><br />
When you use a password manager, it's very important to make sure the one you're using is secure. If you can't trust it 100%, it could be giving your passwords away behind your back, or using inadequate encryption. Also, use a well known brand. The bad guys can make a password manager website designed to steal your passwords, so before you choose one, ask questions and read reviews until you understand how it works, and know that it's secure.
<br /><br />
Most web browsers will offer to save your passwords for you. Generally, it isn't a good idea to use the password managers that are built in to your browser. This is because most of the time, they save your passwords in plain text form (not encrypted). So anyone looking at your computer could easily get all of your passwords. Furthermore, there is malware designed to steal passwords from web browser password managers. Sometimes you may not even notice that you browser is saving the password for you, check in your browser settings and disable the password manager feature if you can. A good alternative password manager is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/locknote/">LockNote</a>. It uses strong encryption to keep your passwords safe.
<h3>Change Your Important Passwords Regularly</h3> 
It's probably a good idea to change your passwords regularly, at least for the important things. It's possible that someone could have found out your password. Of course if you think anyone knows your password, change it right away. But you may not realize that malware on your system has stolen your password, or that there was a keylogger installed on a computer you used in the library or a hotel lobby. You probably don't need to change the passwords for unimportant things, but for important websites like your bank, change the password every month or two. If you have to choose between using a strong password and changing it regularly, opt for the stronger, less frequently changed password. But make sure that if that password ever gets out of your control, change it right away.
<br /><br />
<h3>Never type your password into a computer unless you "know where it's been"</h3>
<center><img src="images/libcomp.jpg" alt="Public Library Computers" /></center>
<br />
One you have created your passwords, you need to be careful not to let them fall into the wrong hands. It may seem like a good idea to sign on to your favorite website at a library or coffee shop, but doing so is very dangerous. Most of these shared computers have keyloggers installed on them. Remember: The bad guys can use them too, and when they use them, they can easily install a keylogger to obtain the usernames and passwords of everyone that uses the computers. Make sure you're smart about which computers you type your passwords into. A work computer that only you use should be OK, but any computer that can be accessed by more than a few people should be cause for concern.
