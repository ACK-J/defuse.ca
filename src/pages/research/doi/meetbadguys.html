<h1>Meet the Bad Guys</h1>
<strong>This guide is being actively developed. It is not finished yet, so some pages and important content will be missing.</strong><br /><br />
This is Part 1 of the <a href="index.php?page=internetdangers">Dangers of the Internet Security Guide</a>.

<h2>Who Are They?</h2>
Anyone, from any country can be a bad guy on the internet. It doesn't take much to start taking advantage of the average and uneducated internet user. An internet "bad guy" could a 12 year old kid living in the United States or a 50 year old woman living in germany. Age, ethnicity, and location all fade away on the internet. The scary fact is, being a bad guy on the internet isn't hard.

<h2>What Do They Want?</h2>
Simple. They want money and fame.
<br /><br />
A lot of the younger bad guys just do what they do for fame. They want to impress the others in the group that they belong to, and improve their reputation in the underground hacking scene.

<h2>How Do They Get It?</h2>
There are many different ways bad guys can make money. They can steal your identity, drain your bank accounts, and use your computer to do their dirty work. Sometimes they attack as many people they can as fast as possible, and sometimes they focus more sophisticated attacks on a single person.

<br /><br />
The most common form of identity theft occurs through spam and phishing. This is where they trick you into giving them money. Both are discussed in <a href="index.php?page=spam">Part 2</a>. 
<br /><br />
Another way they get money is by controlling thousands of computers, and using them to attack and bring down websites. The bad guys infect as many computers as possible with viruses, and then instruct these infected computers to attack a website. This is called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Some bad companies will pay the bad guys to DDoS their competition's websites, so that they get more business. The bad guys infect computers by attacking your home network and exploiting bugs in the software that you use to gain control of your computer. This is covered in <a href="index.php?page=malware">Part 3</a>.
<br /><br />
Sometimes they will attack a website such as an online store, that has lots of credit card info and user login information. They steal the databases from these websites and sell credit card numbers by the millions. They will also check if the password you used for that website is the same password as your email account. If you use the same password for everything, they can use your password to get into your bank, email account, and all of your other online logins.
<br /><br />
Another, less malicious, but still problematic method of making money is with "targeted" ads. Advertising companies use sneaky tricks to track every website you visit. They use this information to display ads that are more suited to you. For example, If you've been looking at a lot of vacation sites, you'll start seeing ads for vacations on websites that aren't even related to vacationing. Most avid internet users see this kind of tracking as a violation of privacy, which is why it is the topic of <a href="index.php?page=privacy">Part 4</a>.
