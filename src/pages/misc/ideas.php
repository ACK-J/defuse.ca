<h1>Ideas</h1>

<p>
Need an idea? I have lots. They all suck so you're free to take them.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> GUI+commandline tool to unify all software documentation, and bring it all offline, so you don't have to google. Maybe community supported.</li>
    <li> Modify the Bochs x86 emulator to demonstrate the problem with the Linux kernel's use of RDRAND.<li>
    <li>Ruby gems as malware infection vector.<li>
    <li>Find a way to make Vim think '-' is part of a word yet not chomp off the dash when doing a dw on foo-&gt;bar() (it makes it &gt;bar).</li>
    <li>Tiger IDS script to check logs for requests that aren't whitelisted.</li>
    <li>GPG and OTR tutorial for noobs.</li>
    <li>Password hashing tutorial VIDEO.</li>
    <li>Tools for visualizing flaws in random number generators.</li>
    <li>Make CrackStation.net look better.</li>
    <li>Write a firefox add-on that makes facebook chat OTR-encrypted.</li>
    <li>Finish EOTP and submit it to a journal. Here's a list of relevant reading:

    </li>
    <li>Implement SSL in Synergy.</li>
    <li>Private file host (open-source PHP code) with pidgin plugin.</li>
    <li>Think of &quot;length encryption&quot; as a solution to BREACH. Maybe send TWO messages of different length, and the attacker can't tell which is the real one.</li>
    <li>Make HTML5 visualization of algorithms.</li>
    <li>Submit something to the PHC.</li>
    <li>Clean up my C# version of blowfish that's on schneier.com.</li>
    <li>Improve my attack on synergy by XORing two sessions together instead of relying on known plaintext.</li>
    <li>Totally portable cryptography library (in C or whatever) so there is no compiler BS to deal with.</li>
    <li>Improve Vim's encryption (there is no MAC or key stretching).</li>
    <li>Use ruby hax to implement Visual Basic's &quot;with&quot; (why the f*** did I want to do this???)</li>
    <li>Make CrackStation use hashtables instead of binary searched sorted lists (generating takes too long on conventional HDDs)</li>
    <li>Can we prove the existence of a hidden truecrypt *OS* by other things like memory in other hardware, other devices on the LAN (routing tables, web history etc)?</li>
    <li>Make a secure session class for Ruby on Rails (encrypted, without the session key it can't actually be accessed).</li>
    <li>Make a theory of why things exist based on the fact that for something to come into existence from nothing, the abstract notion of change had to exist, therefore abstract concepts exist, therefore turing machines exist, and the turing machine's computation exists regardless of whether or not it's actually being written down in a physical medium, therefore the entire universe is just a turing machine. Quantum randomness is caused by a-priori not knowing which TM you're in, and stuff.</li>
    <li>Make HTML-escape plugin for Vim based on my html escape code.</li>
    <li>Break truecrypt plausible deniability by looking for changes and notice out-of-alignment things (e.g. filesystem blocks that should normally appear at e.g. 4K-aligned addrs appearing at 4K+3).</li>
    <li>Security of using web proxies: can a site steal other site's cookies and otherwise violate same-origin policy?</li>
    <li>Can homomorphic encryption be used to check password security against a wordlist when neither party wants to disclose the password OR the wordlist (checking service)? See P. Mohassel's oblivious DFA.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the anonymity guarantees of web proxies. Can you put malformed HTML to get a "real" (un-proxied) link, or better, an image, into the user's browser?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to watch a Turing machine run and learn information about it's state structure? Would it be useful or imply anything interesting?</li>
    <li>Democratic key escrow protocol: To decrypt the ciphertext, gov't needs at least M keys from N civilians, but cannot decide which. Civilians can give a "false" key to object, and gov't can't figure out who it was.</li>
    <li>How good is BitTorrent security? Especially file integrity. What would it take to serve bad files? I think it's SHA-1.</li>
    <li>Attack Freenet with JS injection and CSRF (or whatever).</li>
    <li>Vim RCE using the modeline?</li>
    <li>Can systems be rooted or DoSed through their antivirus update facility? Do any AVs not sign?</li>
    <li>Can client certificates be abused to break Tor anonymity?</li>
    <li>Can network latency be used for supercookie-style tracking? Or geolocation?</li>
    <li>Try to evolve little computer programs by "natural" selection at superfast speeds.</li>
    <li>Figure out how to count Latin Squares.</li>
    <li>Statically infer which functions can be the target of a function pointer by comparing parameter setup (in the caller) and use (in the callee).</li>
    <li>Audit truecrypt code.</li>
</ul>
