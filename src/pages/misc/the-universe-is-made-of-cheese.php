<h1>The Cheese Paradox</h1>


<p>
What follows is a simple proof that the universe is entirely filled with cheese.
Can you find the error(s)?
</p>

<p>
<b>Claim:</b> All points of space-time are simultaneously occupied by
a humongous block of cheese.
<p>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>

<p>
Let <i>FST(x)</i> denote the amount of space-time that is not occupied by an
object <i>x</i>.  This function evaluates to a positive real number or to some
form of infinity, in units of meter-cubed-seconds (<i>m<sup>3</sup>s</i>). This
function can be thought of as being equivalent to the size of the universe minus
the size of the object <i>x</i>, though it need not be defined that way (in
fact, it should not be defined that way, since it would be undefined if either
the size of the universe or the object were infinite).
</p>

<p> 
Let <i>c</i> be the largest conceivable block of cheese such that FST(c) is
minimal. In other words, there is no theoretical block of cheese <i>c'</i> such
that <i>FST(c') &lt; FST(c)</i>.  Clearly, <i>FST(c)</i> is finite, since all
positive infinities are larger than all positive finite reals. So there exists
at most a finite amount of space-time that is not occupied by this block of
cheese, <i>c</i>.
</p>

<p>
Further, <em>every</em> point in space-time must be occupied by <i>c</i>, since
if it were not, it would be possible to construct a block of cheese <i>c'</i>
with <i>FST(c') &lt; FST(c)</i> by placing cheese in the space not occupied by
<i>c</i> and then melting it into <i>c</i> to form a block of cheese with
a lesser value of FST. But there is no such block of cheese <i>c'</i> for which
<i>FST(c') &lt; FST(c)</i>, so this is a contradiction, and therefore it must be
the case that every point in space-time is occupied by <i>c</i>. So <i>FST(c)
= 0</i>.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, every point in space-time is occupied by cheese.  So, in the past,
present, and future, every point of space has been, is, and forever will be
occupied by cheese. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Open Question:</b> While the existence of this block of cheese has been
deductively established, it remains unknown <em>what kind</em> of cheese it
is. Is it cheddar, gouda, or havarti? Or is it a mix of different kinds of
cheese?
