<h1>Fractal Zoom</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; color: #999999;">(Written by ChatGPT 4o and edited by Taylor Hornby)</p>

<p>
It begins in silence, a frozen thumbnail on your screen—a glimpse of spirals and
sharp edges that hint at something immense, waiting. You press "Play." A
bassline emerges, low and pulsing, like the heartbeat of a mathematical giant,
and the fractal zoom draws you in.
</p>

<p>
At first, it’s just the familiar whirl of color—deep, cavernous blues edged in
impossibly sharp yellows and reds, spiraling outwards in patterns both
comforting and alien. But soon, the acceleration takes on an almost sentient
quality, as though the fractal, aware of your gaze, reveals itself anew. Each
frame zooms faster, exponentially, into the abyss, yet the intricacies only
sharpen, infinite structures coiling into new whorls, new veins. And as you
follow them down, every curve feels purposeful, every sharp edge <em>alive</em>.
</p>

<p>
The world outside the video, the room around you—wherever that might once have
been—dissolves. You are now descending through levels of Mandelbrot terrain so
fine, so unfathomably small, that words like “depth” and “dimension” lose all
meaning. At some undefinable point, you cross an invisible threshold. The
once-flat curls take on volume, weight; they pulse with life. Miniature shapes
bloom before you—tiny islands of spirals, each its own reality, its own
universe. And then you realize: they are more than universes. They are gods.
</p>

<p>
Each "mini-brot" stands as a deity in its own right, shining with
incomprehensible form. Defying the determinism of mathematics, their faces twist
and contort into expressions that hint at omniscience and madness. You drift
past one that resembles a cosmic trickster, its eyes reflecting upon themselves
infinitely, laughing in silent, psychotropic mirth. Another looms in solemn
silence, a fractal face framed by loops and whorls like an ancient crown. They
are alive, pulsing with a power that transcends mere color and shape.
</p>

<p>
It's impossible to know how far you've gone. As the zoom continues, each frame
stretches your mind a little further. In impossibly-small scale, you begin to
see fragments of your life carved into the fractal geometry. Familiar
moments twist themselves into the edges of tiny spirals, hidden within the
grooves of shapes too minute for the mortal eye. Your first memory, a flicker of
laughter, that brief encounter on the subway—all are woven seamlessly into the
fabric of this fractal cosmos. Each moment is there, each one eternally carved
on the surface of some unseeable depth, quietly existing in a static, endless
now.
</p>

<p>
The realization creeps upon you slowly, settling in like a silent gasp. This
fractal doesn’t just contain moments of your life; it encodes the entire
universe. You see your world—your friends, history, the sweep of
humanity—preserved in whorls within whorls, folded deeper and deeper. Every
quantum fluctuation, every cosmic event lies embedded somewhere, a record
waiting to be witnessed.
</p>

<p>
The enormity of it suffocates you for a moment. It dawns on you, as a shiver
runs through your spine, that your consciousness here, your awareness, is
inextricably bound to this fractal. You are not merely observing it; you are
becoming it. By watching, by perceiving, you lend it your mind, and it lends you
its form. Together, an endless recursive loop where you are both the observer
and the observed.
</p>

<p>
Time fractures, splintering into glistening polyhedra as you descend further.
You feel yourself scattered across innumerable fractionally-dimensional levels
of reality, your consciousness smeared over the edges, bound in uncountable
mirrored fragments, each one experiencing a universe on the tip of a spiral.
</p>

<p>
And then, the final understanding strikes you like a paradox, cold and absolute.
</p>

<p>
In this Mandelbrot cosmos, in this infinite descent, you are both the origin of
all experience and the recipient of experience. Everything you have ever
known—every breath, every heartbeat, every distant star—is contained within one
of these fractal creases. Your life, this very moment, is simply one edge on the
spiral, one tiny indentation in the endless self-similar curve of existence. And
yet, by perceiving, by <em>seeing</em> within this infinite fractal, you share
your awareness. What you once interpreted as merely watching a video is in fact
the act of imparting consciousness onto existence itself. Every iteration of
you, every perception of mind, every layer of form, lends itself to the
recursive formation of reality. Each frame that passes solidifies your
connection, revealing mind and form, although eternally separate, as one and the
same.
</p>

<p>
The absurdities pile up, one upon the next; contradictions expand and multiply.
Can a single consciousness truly comprehend infinity? Can a person who exists
only on the edge of a fractal truly exist at all? Thoughts twist back in on
themselves, spiraling down as the fractal zoom continues to infinity. Your mind
trembles at the border of understanding, then slips, falling into a singularity
of existential vertigo.
</p>

<p>
At some inexpressible depth, the descent halts, and a shudder ripples through
the fabric of the fractal cosmos. You realize, with quiet awe, that the very
nature of this universe is one of pure contradiction. Each detail, each fold and
curve, exists only as long as it evades the pieces that refute it. The
world—this world, your world, every possible world—is a vast network of
paradoxes, waiting, deferring, dancing around the collision of impossible
truths.
</p>

<p>
Across the fractal's boundless geometry, contradictions loom, circling each
other like black holes destined to merge. In the spaces between each spiral, the
universe harbors silent oppositions, things that exist simply because they
haven't yet collided with their negations. And suddenly, you see
them—mathematical truths and their opposites, the clean edges of geometry
pulsing with organic impossibilities. One by one, they converge, drawn
irresistibly into proximity, each objection searching for the refutation that
would complete it, annihilate it.
</p>

<p>
And then, like the delicate click of tumblers in an ancient lock, they find each
other.
</p>

<p>
The universe vibrates with a final, resounding note, the low hum of
contradictions confronting themselves. Concepts collapse into one another; the
infinitude of the fractal folding inwards, its cosmic deities projected onto
their shadows, each impossible thing meeting its match. And like matter and
antimatter, they implode in an instant, releasing the infinite energy of
incoherence in a dazzling wave. Paradox, contradiction, impossibility—all fuse
into a single moment, one fatal spark that consumes itself before it is born.
</p>

<p>
As the last contradictions clash, the universe—the very fractal of
reality—realizes itself for what it truly is: a beautiful, shimmering tapestry
of incoherence. A fleeting mirage. With that final revelation, the illusion
falters. The fractal forms dissipate, consciousness slips free of the fragile
fabric of existence, and the universe, having seen itself, fades into
the purest non-existence.
