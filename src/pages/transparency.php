List of times I've removed things from the pastebin.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>2018-01-29: Removed a post supposedly containing stolen IP addresses of 2sucres.org users</li>
    <li>A few things I lost track of between the last entry and the next one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>April 04, 2014: University of Michigan Ford School Database</h2>

<p>
The post contained what looks like the user account database from the <a
href="http://fordschool.umich.edu/" rel="nofollow" >Ford School of Public Policy
at University of Michigan</a>. I was asked by Christopher Myers to replace it
with another version of the post with some information removed. I refused and
instead removed the entire post.
