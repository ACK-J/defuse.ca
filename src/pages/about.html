<h1>About Defuse Cyber-Security</h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>I'm a computer security enthusiast that that enjoys programming, hacking, and listening to the <a href="http://grc.com/sn">SecurityNow!</a> netcast. I created this website to give me a place to publish all of my code, research, and projects. This site will mostly be security related, but if I make something useful I'll release it on here. I'm a strong believer in open source software, so I'll try to make everything I release open source, using the GNU GPL.</p>

<h2>Defuse.ca's Privacy Policy</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This website will never track you.</li>
	<li>You will never need cookies to use this website.</li>
	<li>I will never put ads on this site no matter how popular it gets.</li>
	<li>I will refrain from including external content (from other domains) as much as possible.</li>
	<li>This site will always be functional with JavaScript disabled.</li>
	<li>I keep no logs other than the SHA256 hash of your IP for the hit counter (explained below).</li>
	<li>Unfortunately, I cannot extend this policy to my <a href="http://blog.defuse.com/">blog</a> since it's hosted by Google.</li>

<h3>The Hit Counter</h3>
<p>In order to count unique hits, I must be able to tell if an IP address has visited a page in the past. I do not store the IP address directly, I hash them along with the name of the page (like salt). Since the IPs are hashed using the page name as salt, I can tell if an IP has visited a specific page in the past but I cannot enumerate the IP addresses that have visited a page or correlate hits from the same IP across different pages. To do so, I would have to crack the IP hashes, which would involve creating a 4 Billion entry look-up table for each page on this site. The look-up tables would take up more than 2 Terabytes of hard drive space and would take over a month to create. Obviously, I'm not going to be doing that anytime soon. :) </p>

<p>If you don't want even a hash of your IP to be stored, you can enable the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Do_not_track_header"><b>DNT: 1</b></a> (Do Not Track) header in your browser. If my server sees <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b>DNT: 1</b></span> in the headers your browser sends, nothing will be recorded and the hit counters will not be incremented.</p>

<p>You can get the source code for the hit counter here: <a href="/php-hit-counter.htm">"Privacy Aware" Unique Hit Counter for PHP</a>.</p>

<h2>Like the Script-Free Menu?</h2>

<p>The JavaScript-free drop-down menu that you see near the top of every page on this website was created and released into the public domain by <a href="http://grc.com/">Steve Gibson</a>. If you run a website, I highly recommend checking it out since it works very well with nearly every browser, and most security conscious users browse the web with JavaScript disabled.</p>
