<h1>About Defuse Security</h1>

<p>
Defuse Security is Taylor Hornby's security research and development group. We
try to learn how to make systems more secure, and then write software that does
that. For example, we maintain one of the symmetric cryptography libraries for
PHP that isn't riddled with vulnerabilities, as well as a password generator
that we've taken care to keep free of side-channel vulnerabilities.

<h2>Like the Script-Free Drop-Down Menu?</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.grc.com/intro.htm">Steve Gibson</a> created the CSS-only
