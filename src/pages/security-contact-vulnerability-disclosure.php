<h1>Security Contact and Vulnerability Disclosure</h1>

<p>
All security bugs in Defuse Security services and software should be immediately
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29">
fully disclosed
</a>. 
The best way to do this is, if the thing has a GitHub repository, to open an
issue in the GitHub issue tracker. If not, write a blog post on your own website
and email me the link, or email me a description of the vulnerability and I will
post it to my blog on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
If you feel uncomfortable disclosing a vulnerability without first notifying me,
you can <a href="/contact.htm">email me</a> (PGP preferred), but this is
unnecessary.
