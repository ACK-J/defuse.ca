<h1>Jobs/Tasks</h1>

<p>
This page lists small tasks that I want to do, but don't have time to do. If you
complete one of them successfully, I will pay you (by Paypal or Bitcoin). If two
people do the same thing, I will pay the one who finished it first. I reserve
the right to not pay anybody anything.
