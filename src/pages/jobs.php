<h1>Jobs/Tasks</h1>

<p>
This page lists small tasks that I want to do, but don't have time to do. If you
complete one of them successfully, I will pay you (by Paypal or Bitcoin). If two
people do the same thing, I will pay the one who finished it first. I reserve
the right to not pay anybody anything.

<h2>Linux Kernel /dev/random Cache Side Channel</h2>

<pre>
I will pay: $50 USD.

There is a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/char/random.c#L516">
possible cache side channel vulnerability in /dev/random</a>. Create
a compelling case (possibly a PoC) for its existence and report it to the Linux
kernel people.
