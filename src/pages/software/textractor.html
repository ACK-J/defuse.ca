<h1>Textractor - Wordlist Creator</h1>
<p>This is a <b>command line</b> C# .NET tool for extracting words from large files. It works on Windows with the .NET framework and on Linux with Mono. It is most useful when used against large, text-based databases to create wordlists. It's what I used to create part of <a href="http://crackstation.net/">crackstation.net</a>'s wordlists from the Wikipedia databases.</p>
