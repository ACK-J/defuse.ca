<h1>HelloWorld! PHP CMS - Light &amp; Secure</h1>
<p>This is the &quot;CMS&quot; we use to give each page on this website the same header and navbar. It was designed to be as simple as possible. Through this simplicity, we obtain a much higher level of security than that of a complex and feature packed CMS like WordPress.
