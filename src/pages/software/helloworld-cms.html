<h1>HelloWorld! PHP CMS - Light &amp; Secure</h1>
<p>I've decided to release the CMS that I use for this website (ossbox.com). I designed it to be as SIMPLE as possible. Through this simplicity, we obtain a much higher level of security than that of a complex and feature packed CMS like WordPress. If you just need a simple website, this is the CMS for you.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Script-Free CSS Menuing System. (created by <a href="http://grc.com/">http://grc.com/</a>)</li>
	<li>Doesn't requre database software.</li>
	<li>Very simple &amp; secure.</li>
	<li>Highly customizable.</li>
	<li>Free (open source).</li>
	<li>Easily create many pages with the same layout.</li>
	<li>To use it, all you'll need to know is HTML and a bit of PHP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Please enjoy using HelloWorld! I hope you find it useful. If you have any questions about how to get it set up, please <a href="/contact.htm">write me an email</a>, I'll be glad to help you set it up.
