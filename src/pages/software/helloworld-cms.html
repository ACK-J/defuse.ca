<h1>HelloWorld! - A Light &amp; Secure &quot;CMS&quot; for PHP</h1>
<div style="border: dashed 1px black; padding: 10px;">

<center><b>UPDATE:</b></center>
I have just finished writing a much faster and more robust URL parser, which I will be adding to
the HelloWorld! CMS shortly. Stay tuned for updates!
</div>

<p>This is the &quot;CMS&quot; we use to give each page on this website the same header and navbar. It was designed to be as simple as possible. Through this simplicity, we obtain a much higher level of security than that of a complex and feature packed CMS like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla. If you just need a simple website and you're familiar with HTML and CSS, HelloWorld! will do the job.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Doesn't require database software.</li>
	<li>Very simple &amp; secure.</li>

	<li>To use it, all you'll need to know is HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of PHP.</li>
</ul>
