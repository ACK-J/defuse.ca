<h1>Secure Password Generator</h1>
<p>Generating truly random passwords is hard to do, but luckily Windows and Linux come with very good random number generators! There are some good online password generators such as <a href="http://www.grc.com/passwords">GRC's Perfect Passwords</a>, but you have to trust the server not to give your passwords to someone else. This is why generating passwords from your personal computer is the safest thing to do.</p>

<h2>How are the passwords generated?</h2>
<p>The passwords are generated by pulling a huge random number from the operating system's random number generator. The cross platform code gets it from /dev/random, a real random number generator in unix systems. The Windows application gets it from RNGCryptoServiceProvider. To create each character in the password, it divides the huge number by the character set length. The remainder of the division is used as the index of the character in the character set. The result of the division is divided again and again to generate the next characters.</p>
