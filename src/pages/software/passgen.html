<h1>High-Security Offline Password Generator</h1>
<p>Online password generators like <a href="http://grc.com/passwords.htm">GRC's Perfect Passwords</a> can be very useful, but by using them you are trusting them not to remember your password and share it with third parties. I invite you to download one of my FREE and open source <b>OFFLINE</b> password generators so <b>YOUR PC</b> can create strong passwords with the click of a button. The Windows GUI version combines data from the Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) built into Windows with random mouse movements to produce extremely secure passwords that are completely unique to you. The Linux version creates passwords from TRULY RANDOM noise obtained from <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki//dev/random">/dev/random</a>.</p>

To open the command line, <nobr><kbd>Press Start &gt; Run &gt; Type "cmd.exe" and hit ENTER</kbd></nobr>.
