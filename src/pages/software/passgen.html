<h1>High-Security Offline Password Generator</h1>
<p>Online password generators like <a href="http://grc.com/passwords.htm">GRC's Perfect Passwords</a> can be very useful, but by using them you are trusting them not to remember your password and share it with third parties. I invite you to download one of my FREE and open source <b>OFFLINE</b> password generators so <b>YOUR PC</b> can create strong passwords with the click of a button. The Windows GUI version combines data from the Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) built into Windows with random mouse movements to produce extremely secure passwords that are completely unique to you. The Linux version creates passwords from TRULY RANDOM noise obtained from <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki//dev/random">/dev/random</a>.</p>

<h2>Windows GUI Version</h2>
<p>This version runs on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003+.</p>

<strong>AntiVirus False Positives</strong>
<p>The Windows executable is detected as a virus by the heuristics engines in the following antivirus programs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AhnLab-V3</li>
    <li>AntiVir</li>
    <li>Avast</li>
    <li>BitDefender</li>
    <li>F-Secure</li>
    <li>GData</li>
    <li>VIPRE</li>
</ul>
<p>See scan results <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=b8c5a42d3237bd9e3a9ce2e5afd8f6526ac92c1e114a332ef8034cdb935ce935-1317582782">here</a>. These detections are caused by part of the open source (benign) SHA256 code used to mix the entropy pool. I've verified that the SHA256 code <b>is</b> secure. Malware writers using the open source code is probably the reason for the false positives. In any case, you may compile the source code and compare it with the .exe to check for yourself that the file is safe. I will replace the detected SHA256 code with another implementation as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>For those interested: Lines 112 through 175 of sha256.c are the source of the problem.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/source/passgen.cpp">C++ Source Code (GNU GPL 3)</a> - 8KB.</strong></p>
<h3>How to Install on Linux</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Download passgen.cpp.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have g++ installed (apt-get install g++).</li>
	<li>Run: g++ passgen.cpp -o passgen</li>
	<li>The previous step created an executable file named 'passgen', move it into /usr/bin/</li>
	<li>You should now be able to run the 'passgen' command to access the password generator.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to Install on Windows</h3>
<p>The easiest way to install the command line password generator on Windows is to download the executable (.exe) file and copy it into your <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><kbd>C:\Windows\System32\</kbd></span> directory. After doing so, you will be able to run the password generator by typing "passgen" in the Windows command line. To open the command line, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><kbd>Press Start &gt; Run &gt; Type "cmd.exe" and hit ENTER</kbd></span>. If the Run option isn't present in your start menu, you can open it by holding down the Windows key and pressing R.</p>
