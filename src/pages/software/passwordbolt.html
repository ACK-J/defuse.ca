<h1>PasswordBolt [BETA]</h1>

<div style="border: dashed 1px black; padding: 10px;">
<center><b>UPDATE:</b></center>
I am currently writing a new PHP user account system, which I will use to completely rewrite PasswordBolt. As a part of the rewrite, I'll make it a lot more user friendly, including a Windows installer and automatic backup provisions. I'm hoping it will turn out to be something as useful as LastPass that you can host at home, but I don't expect to be able to work on it for a few months.
</div>

<p>Password Bolt is a new web based password manager. It was designed because there are currently no other open source web based password managers. It is still in it's peer review and development process, so a stable release is not available yet. Setting it up is just a matter of copying the php files and importing the SQL database. Feel free to download and try it out! </p>

<p>PasswordBolt is open source, so if you're an open source person, feel free to take this and improve it on your own because I use this personally but I don't have time to maintain it as an open source project.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>AES-TWOFISH-SERPENT encryption done <u>right</u>. (overkill, I know.)</li>
<li>SHA512-HMAC AND WHIRLPOOL-HMAC used to generate the encryption key.</li>
<li>JavaScript Blowfish encryption</li>
<li>Optional multifactor authentication with a keyfile.</li>
<li>Provides plausible deniability.</li>
<li><s>Optional S/KEY (one time password) multifactor authentication.</s></li>
</ul>
