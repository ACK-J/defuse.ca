<h1>Peer Review &amp; Security Consulting</h1>
<p>Security review is a critical part of the software development process. Malicious hackers are attacking anything and everything these days. Insecure software leaves it's users vulnerable to these attacks. Software insecurity can come from something as small as forgetting to sanitize user input, to implementing a completely insecure crypto-system. These insecurities <b>will</b> be exploited. There is no way to prevent them altogether, the best you can do is to be proactive about security - have your product, idea, or protocol reviewed, and have your development team trained to combat security flaws. </p>

<p>Backed with my extensive knowledge of security and applied cryptography, I offer inexpensive security consulting. I'll review your product and provide extensive reports on the security status of the product. If I find it to be secure, you'll get to put "Approved Secure by OSSBox" graphics on your web site to increase your users' faith in your product.</p>


<p>Too often in the software industry, security gets overlooked in favor of functionality and cost cutting. Getting your product reviewed shows that you <b>truly care</b> about your users' security. I charge as little as possible for this service because I just want to help make secure software, and I believe that software developers should be rewarded for going the extra mile to make their products secure.</p>
