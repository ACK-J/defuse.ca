<h1>Peer Review &amp; Security Testing</h1>

<p>Security is hard. The only way to obtain a higher level of security is through peer review. When many people study a solution to a problem, they can be more sure that it is the <i>correct</i> solution. Nobody can catch all of the mistakes themselves, sometimes you need a third party to look at your ideas. That is what I intend to do. I will review your software, cryptographic protocol, or ideas for security weaknesses.</p>

<p>If your software is going to be released as free (as in freedom) or open source, I will generally review it for free. If your software or idea is closed source, or will be patented, I will charge a small amount for the work that I do.</p>

<h2>What You Get</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Thorough review of your software, protocol, or idea.</li>
	<li>Report including all possible attack vectors and mitigations of these threats.</li>
	<li>OSSBox Seal of Approval if we find your software to be secure.</li>
	<li>Greater level of user trust because a third party is putting their name behind your software.</li>
	<li>Web page on ossbox.com describing the security features of your product along side our in-depth analysis.</li>
	<li>If found to be insecure, you will get tips on how to improve your software or idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<ul>
	<li>FREE for open source and free (as in freedom) software. (When time permits)</li>
	<li>$20 per hour for closed source or patented technology. An average review takes about 1 to 2 hours.</li>
	<li>Free if you are not satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>This is NOT malicious hacking for hire. It is impossible for any one person to find all the security problems in a system. Therefore, I cannot possibly guarantee I will find them ALL problems, but I do try my best.</p>
