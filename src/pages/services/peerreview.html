<h1>Peer Review &amp; Security Consulting</h1>
<p><strong>Security review is a critical part of the software development process.</strong> Cyber-criminals are attacking anything and everything these days, and insecure software leaves it's users vulnerable. Software insecurity can come from something as simple as forgetting to sanitize user input to implementing a poorly thought out cryptosystem.</p>

<p>The best way to let your users know your that product is top-quality is to be proactive about security. Have your product, idea, or protocol reviewed, and have your development team trained to combat security flaws. Backed with my knowledge of security and applied cryptography, I offer inexpensive security consulting. I'll review your product and provide extensive reports on the effectiveness of it's security systems. If I find it to be secure, you'll get to put "Approved Secure by Defuse Cyber-Security" graphics on your web site to increase your users' faith in your product.</p>

<p>Before you start to think that this is just another software certification program like <a href="http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a>, know this...</p>

<center>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color:#003181;">I don't just run through a checklist of known bad practices...<br />
...I <b>actively pound on your product</b> until I break it.</span>
</center>

<p>Too often in the software industry, security gets overlooked in favor of functionality and cost cutting. Getting your product reviewed shows that you <b>truly care</b> about your users' security. I charge as little as possible for this service because I just want to help make secure software, and I believe that software developers should be rewarded for going the extra mile to make their products secure.</p>

<span style="font-size:20px; color:#920000;">If you really care about your users' security, this is for you.</span>
