<h1>Peer Review &amp; Security Testing</h1>

<p>Security is hard. The only way to obtain a higher level of security is through peer review. When many people study a solution to a problem, they can be more sure that it is the <i>correct</i> solution. Nobody can catch all of the mistakes themselves, sometimes you need a third party to look at your ideas. That is what I intend to do. I will review your software, cryptographic protocol, or ideas for security weaknesses.</p>

<p>This is NOT malicious hacking for hire. Security is a process; it is impossible for any one person to find all the security problems in a system. Therefore, I cannot possibly guarantee I will find them ALL problems, but I do try my best, and it's free if you're not satisfied.</p>
