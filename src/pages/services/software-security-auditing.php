<h1>Is your software secure?</h1>

<p>
I want to work with you to make sure your code is secure. So I've decided to
start a part-time security auditing service. I'm available 10 hours per week, for
$20 CAD per hour, to look over your designs and code to make sure they are
secure. To give back to the community, I'll reduce my rate to $15 per hour for
published free software (under a GPL-like license).
</p>

<p>
I am not an experienced code auditor, but it's something I <a
href="http://www.cryptofails.com/">really like to do</a>,
and I am pretty good with security (see my <a
href="/resume.htm">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>). So this will also be a learning experience for
me. That's good for you, too: I will not charge for the time I need to spend
learning new technologies in order to evaulate your security. I'll only charge
for the time I'm actually looking at your design/code and writing reports.
</p>

<p>
What I can do:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check web code for XSS, SQL injection, session, password hashing, etc.  vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Evaulate the design and implementation of cryptography software.</li>
    <li>Look for memory corruption bugs in C and C++ code.</li>
    <li>Write proof-of-concept exploits for vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Check the security of your Linux server and the services it runs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am especially interested in auditing software that uses cryptography.
</p>

<p>
To make the most effective use of my limited time, I will work with you to
prioritize which parts of your application should be audited first. When the
audit is complete, I will work with you to ensure the problems are fixed
correctly.
