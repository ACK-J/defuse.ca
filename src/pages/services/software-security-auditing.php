<h1>Software Security Auditing</h1>

<p>
<b>NOTE: I am taking a heavy university course load until next May, so I won't
be able to take on any new consulting jobs for the next few months. Thanks for
understanding.</b>
</p>

<p>
I want to work with you to make sure your code is secure. I'm available 10 hours
per week, for $50 CAD per hour, to look over your designs and code to make sure
they are secure. To give back to the community, I'll reduce my rate to <b>$30
per hour</b> for published free or open source software (GPL-like or BSD-like
license).
</p>

<p>
What I can do:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check web code for XSS, SQL injection, session, password hashing, etc. vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the design and implementation of cryptography software.</li>
    <li>Look for memory corruption bugs in C and C++ code.</li>
    <li>Write proof-of-concept exploits for vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Check the configuration of your Linux server.</li>
    <li>Responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to vendors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some examples of my work:

<ul>
    <li><a href="/audits/encfs.htm">EncFS</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/ecryptfs.htm">eCryptfs</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/pefs.htm">PEFS</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/zerobin.htm">ZeroBin</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cryptofails.com/">Crypto Fails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
To make the most effective use of my time, I will work with you to prioritize
which parts of your application should be audited first. When the audit is
complete, I will work with you to ensure the problems are fixed correctly.
