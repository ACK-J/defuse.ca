<h1>Software Security Auditing</h1>

<p>
I want to work with you to make sure your code is secure. I'm available for an
daily rate to look over your designs and code to make sure they are secure. To
give back to the community, I reduce my rate for published free or open source
software (GPL, BSD, CC0, etc.)
</p>

<p>
What I can do:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check web code for XSS, SQL injection, session, password hashing, etc. vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the design and implementation of cryptography software.</li>
    <li>Look for memory corruption bugs in C and C++ code.</li>
    <li>Write proof-of-concept exploits for vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Check the configuration of your Linux server.</li>
    <li>Responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to vendors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some examples of my work:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/audits/encfs.htm">EncFS</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/ecryptfs.htm">eCryptfs</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/pefs.htm">PEFS</a></li>
    <li><a href="/audits/zerobin.htm">ZeroBin</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://blog.crypto.cat/2014/02/contest-find-bugs-win-a-sphero-2-0/">Cryptocat Bug Hunt</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/keboola/php-encryption/issues/3">Padding Oracle PoC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
To make the most effective use of my time, I will work with you to prioritize
which parts of your application should be audited first. When the audit is
complete, I will work with you to ensure the problems are fixed correctly.
