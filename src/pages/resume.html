</ul>

<h2>Programming Skills</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the best way to judge a programmer's skill is by observing how fast they can learn a new technology or familiarize themselves with a different paradigm. In the ever-changing world of technology, willingness to learn is key. That's where I excel. I can familiarize myself with a new programming language in a single day of self-driven research, and <b>I'm always willing to learn something new to get the job done</b>.</p>

<p>It takes more than just being able to learn quickly to be a good programmer. Good programmers care about their work and enjoy doing it. They find the best solution to a problem even when the code they are working on is insignificant to the project. They aren't afraid to open up code they didn't write to fix a bug. They write each line of code with security in mind, constantly analyzing their own work for security vulnerabilities. I do all of these things, because <b>I truly love programming</b>.</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of technologies and programming languages that I've used and am familiar with. The "Adept" section contains languages that I use on a daily basis for personal projects. The "Skilled" section lists languages that I've had lots of experience with but might not have used in a while. The "Basic" section contains languages that I have used but haven't had much experience with.</p>
