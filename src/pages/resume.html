<h1>My R&eacute;sum&eacute; </h1>
<p>I am a (mostly) self educated programmer and security researcher. Working in the field of software development and security is not only a career for me, it is a hobby. I am a very fast learner.  I have a good understanding of most computer science topics such as complexity theory, cryptography, database design, operating systems, and hardware.
I am also knowledgeable in a wide range of subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics.</p>
