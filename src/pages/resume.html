<h3>University of Calgary (2010 - present)</h3>

I am in my fourth year of study for a Computer Science degree with
a concentration in Information Security at the University of Calgary. My GPA is
currently 3.604 and I am on the Faculty of Science's Dean's list for 2012.
I also received a
<a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/provost/TLFC/awards/undergrad">PURE Award</a>
from the University of Calgary (see the Experience section below).

<h3>High School</h3>

I went to William Aberhart High School in Calgary. I took introductory computer
science courses there, which I passed with an average of 95% and in which
I received two academic excellence awards. I was in the French immersion
program, so I can speak French (not very fluently, though). I also played the
alto saxophone in junior high and in the first year of high school, so I have
some background in music theory.

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Personal Projects and Free Software (2010 - present)</h3>

<p>
I write code and hack things in my spare time. Most of my code is either on this
website or <a href="https://github.com/defuse">on GitHub</a>. Here are my
favorite projects:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://crackstation.net/">CrackStation</a> - An online hash cracking service.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cryptofails.com/">Crypto Fails</a> - A website showcasing bad cryptography.</li>
    <li><a href="https://defuse.ca/socstress.htm">Sockstress</a> - An implementation of the DoS attack on TCP.</li>
    <li><a href="https://defuse.ca/cracking-synergy-bad-cryptography.htm">Cracking Synergy's Bad Cryptography</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-newsgroups">PHP Newsgroups</a> - A newsgroup-style PHP forum.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since 2011 I have been running my own Linux web server to host this website and
CrackStation. This involves setting up, securing, and maintaining Apache (HTTP),
BIND (DNS), Postfix (SMTP), and Dovecot (IMAP), etc. servers. I have also been
a &quot;full-time&quot; Linux user since 2010.
</p>

<h3>PURE Research Project (Summer 2013 - present)</h3>

<p>
Through the summer of 2013, I worked with 
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~locasto/">Dr. Michael E. Locasto</a> on
a research project exploring the feasibility of &quot;Instruction Filters&quot;
(disabling parts of the CPU's instruction set) as a defense against code
reuse exploits. This project is still a work in progress, but you can see the
slides from a presentation I gave about the project
<a href="https://defuse.ca/files2/insfilter.pdf">here</a>. The research was
funded by a <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/provost/TLFC/awards/undergrad">PURE
Award</a> from the University of Calgary.
<p>

<p>
The project involved:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Designing the defense system and modifications to the x86 architecture.</li>
    <li>Implementing the architecture changes in the Bochs x86 CPU emulator.</li>
    <li>Modifying the Linux kernel to support the architecture changes.</li>
    <li>Using static instrumentation software (PEBIL) to add the defense system to compiled ELF binaries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hitachi ID Systems, Inc. (Summers of 2012, 2011)</h3>

<p>
In the summers of 2011 and 2012, I worked for <a href="http://hitachi-id.com/">Hitachi ID Systems, Inc.</a>.
My responsibilities involved developing a set of web-application tests using the
&quot;watir&quot; framework, reviewing C++ source code for vulnerabilities (and
fixing them), analysing the security of cryptographic protocols, and fixing
bugs.
