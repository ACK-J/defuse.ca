<h1>My R&eacute;sum&eacute; </h1>
<p>Working in the field of software development and security is not only a career for me, it is a hobby. I am a very fast learner.  I have a good understanding of most computer science topics such as complexity theory, cryptography, database design, operating systems, and hardware. I am also knowledgeable in a wide range of subjects such as physics and math.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Programming Skills</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the best way to judge a programmer's skill is by observing how fast they can learn a new technology or familiarize themselves with a different paradigm. In the ever-changing world of technology, willingness to learn is key. That's where I excel. I can familiarize myself with a new programming language in a single day of self-driven research, and <b>I'm always willing to learn something new to get the job done</b>.</p>

<p>It takes more than just being able to learn quickly to be a good programmer. Good programmers care about their work and enjoy doing it. I always strive to find the <em>best</em> solution to the problem, even if it means I have to write the code more than once. I write each line of code with security as a top priority, constantly analyzing my own work for vulnerabilities. I do all of these things because <b>I truly love programming</b>.</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of technologies and programming languages that I've used and am familiar with. The "Adept" section contains languages that I use on a daily basis for personal projects. The "Skilled" section lists languages that I've had lots of experience with but might not have used in a while. The "Basic" section contains languages that I have used but haven't had much experience with.</p>

<p>Below you will find a list of programming languages I've had experience with. They are listed in
order from most skilled to least skilled. The ones highlighted in green are the ones I'm best at
and use on a daily basis. Highlighted in yellow are the ones I have had significant experience with,
but may not have used in a while. In red are languages I've had very little experience but am
interested in learning. Hover your mouse over the language for more information.</p>
