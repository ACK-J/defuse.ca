</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a class="reference external" href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>'s user database has been <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">breached</a>. The passwords were hashed with
SHA1, but salt was not used. 6 million of them have been published to the
internet. You can download them via <a class="reference external" href="http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7334648/LinkedIn_Password_Hashes">torrent</a> or via HTTP from <a class="reference external" href="http://defuse.ca/files/linkedin-sha1.txt">defuse.ca's
mirror</a>. 3.5 million of them have had their first 5 hex digits replaced with
zero -- some suspect this was used as a way to mark which have been cracked by
another party <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073928">(source)</a>.</p>
<p>A bit of googling reveals that LinkedIn has about 120 million registered
accounts, so the 6,143,150 hashes represent about 5% of LinkedIn users
Correction: Since duplicates were removed from the hash list, it must represent
a much larger portion of LinkedIn users. Since passwords are so often re-used,
I wouldn't be surprised if it was the entire database. 3,521,180 have been
cracked by an unknown third party. That leaves 2,621,970 for me to try to crack
with <a class="reference external" href="https://crackstation.net/">CrackStation</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-crackstation">
<h2>What is CrackStation?</h2>
<p>CrackStation is basically a giant lookup table -- a sorted list of hashes,
mapped to their corresponding plaintext. To crack a hash, all I have to do is
run a binary search through the hash index file to get the location of the
plaintext in the wordlist file. This process is very efficient; a 200GB index
file (15 billion hashes) can be searched in only a fraction of a second, even on
a standard 7200rpm hard disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crackstation-results">
<h2>CrackStation Results</h2>
<p>It took 31.8 hours to process all 2,621,970 not-yet-cracked hashes. That's an
average of 22 hashes processed per second. In the end, I was able to crack
31,831 hashes -- about 1.2%. CrackStation's &quot;medium&quot; dictionary, which has
1,493,677,782 entries, cracked 23,529 (0.8%) of them. The &quot;huge&quot; dictionary,
which has 15,171,326,912 cracked 10034 (0.3%) of them. These figures are not
exclusive -- 1732 hashes were cracked by both dictionaries (I did not optimize).</p>
<p>Duplicates were removed from the original list of hashes, so I cannot provide
&quot;most common passwords&quot; statistics. Here's a random sample of what I cracked (I
will not be releasing the full list):</p>

<p>These results aren't really meaningful, since I only tried to crack the set of
hashes that were not already cracked by someone else, but it was a fun exercise
to test the strength of CrackStation's password dictionaries. It is also a great
demonstration of why salt is <strong>crucial</strong> to password security. If we assume that
all of the previously-cracked hashes could have been cracked by CrackStation,
then I would have been able to crack 3,553,011 (57.8%) in only 78 hours, or 19
hours if cracked them in parallel on a quad-disk quad-core system. That figure
is consistent with other bulk cracking jobs CrackStation has done in the past.</p>
<p>The reason I cannot crack the ones that had their first 5 hex digits set to
00000 is because CrackStation's indexes are sorted on the first 48 bits of the
hash, with the first bits being the most significant. Without all of those bits,
I can't do a binary search through the index file. I could rebuild the index
using the last 48 bits of the hash, but that would take days and hundreds of
gigabytes of hard drive space. I don't want LinkedIn users' passwords that bad.
If there is significant public interest in the results, then I will consider
doing it.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This kind of attack wouldn't work if the hashes were salted. If they were
salted, I'd have to run a dictionary attack on each hash individually, which can
take upwards of an hour per hash for a similar-quality attack. So if you run
a website that stores user passwords, please make sure they are <a class="reference external" href="https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm">hashed with
salt</a>. If they aren't, (LinkedIn, are you listening?), then you are an
irresponsible webmaster.</p>
