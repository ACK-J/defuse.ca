&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every week, spend at least an hour reviewing what you did the previous week.
Think of what you could have done better to increase X even more. Apply the
things you find to the next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every month, spend at least an hour reviewing your review process. Are your
weekly reviews making you improve X? Think about how you could make your
review process better. Do you need more time for the weekly reviews? What
other changes to the reviews can you make so they're more effective? Apply
these changes in the next month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every year, spend at least an hour reviewing your monthly review of review
process. Are your monthly reviews improving the effectiveness of your weekly
reviews? How can you make your monthly reviews better? Apply these changes in
the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every 5 years, review the yearly reviews in the same way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you graph y = X(t) as a curve, the days of your life represent actual
increases in the value of X. The weekly reviews represent increases in the slope
(first derivative) of X(t), making it increase faster. The monthly reviews
increases the rate at which the slope of X(t) increases (second derivative). The
yearly reviews increase the rate at which the rate at which the slope is
increasing (third derivative). The 5-year reviews increase the fourth
derivative, and so on, if you wish to apply more levels of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this process to be the best a human being can do to approximate
exponential growth of some property of themselves within their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Enabling TLS 1.1 in Firefox 23" src="https://defuse.ca/images/ff23-tls.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a new tab and type &lt;a class="reference external" href="about:config"&gt;about:config&lt;/a&gt; into the address bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for tls.version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set security.tls.version.max to 2. This enables TLS 1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set security.tls.version.min to 1. This disables SSL 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that setting tls.version.max to 3 will enable TLS v1.2 in a future
release of Firefox, but setting it to 3 in version 23 actually makes it fall
back to using &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; TLS 1.0. So for now, set it to 2.&lt;/p&gt;

(Guest Post)</title><link href="/blog2/what-is-ddos.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Breshie</name></author><id>tag:/blog2,2013-05-12:what-is-ddos.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a guest post by BreShiE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDoS attacks are becoming more and more frequent in today's world, with any
average person being able to download or purchase such tools from online, public
forums. You may have heard about the self proclaimed hacktivist group
&amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot; and their infamous take-downs of websites such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Payback"&gt;MasterCard,
PayPal and The Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;. Well, these websites were taken offline for
a period of time by an attack known as &amp;quot;DDoS&amp;quot;, but what is DDoS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDoS&lt;/strong&gt; stands for &lt;strong&gt;Distributed Denial of Service&lt;/strong&gt;. DDoS attacks work by
collecting multiple infected machines or servers with certain scripts, or
malware, intended to send data from the infected server or home connection to
a victims. This means the attacker can overload the victim connection, by
flooding it with loads and loads of dummy data, eventually causing the victim
connection to overload, &amp;quot;knocking&amp;quot; the connection offline and making it
unresponsive. See the below diagram for an example of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/breshie-ddos.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above diagram, the attacker sends a command to the
servers/PCs that are under his/her control, which then send the dummy data to
the victim connection and overloads the connection, making it hard or impossible
for the victim's users to communicate with the victim. There's also what is
known as &amp;quot;DoS&amp;quot; which is often not as strong as a DDoS attack, but if the
attacker is using a server with a strong connection, this attack can still be
devastating. One thing to &lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt; would be that there are companies which fight
to prevent this exact attack and that is why you never see big sites like eBay,
YouTube and Google go down. With this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17472447"&gt;huge scare about &amp;quot;hackers being able to
take down the internet&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, it's baloney. The only way it would be possible, is
if the data-centers were to be physically blown up, not DDoS attacks via the
internet.  If you wish to know more on this subject, visit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial_of_service#Distributed_attack"&gt;Wikipedia's page on

to switch virtual desktops (also known as workspaces) with the buttons on the
side of my mouse. Here's how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, install &lt;strong&gt;xbindkeys&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;xdotool&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then create a &lt;strong&gt;.xbindkeysrc&lt;/strong&gt; file in your home folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block"&gt;
vim ~/.xbindkeysrc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into this file, put the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code text literal-block"&gt;
# -- Move Right --
# This is the general command that works with any number of workspaces:
# &amp;quot;xdotool set_desktop $(expr $(expr $(xdotool get_desktop) + 1) % $(xdotool get_num_desktops))&amp;quot;
# This is the optimized command for 5 workspaces:
&amp;quot;xdotool set_desktop $(expr $(expr $(xdotool get_desktop) + 1) % 5)&amp;quot;
    b:8

# -- Move Left --
# This is the general command that works with any number of workspaces:
# &amp;quot;xdotool set_desktop $(expr $(expr $(xdotool get_desktop) + $(expr $(xdotool get_num_desktops) - 1)) % $(xdotool get_num_desktops))&amp;quot;
# This is the optimized command for 5 workspaces:
&amp;quot;xdotool set_desktop $(expr $(expr $(xdotool get_desktop) + 4) % 5)&amp;quot;
    b:9
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above config, replace &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; with the number of the button you want to use
to move right, and &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; with the number of the button you want to use to move
left. If you don't know what the button numbers are, run &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;xev&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, press the
one you want while hovering your mouse over the window, and you'll see it in the
output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command that's uncommented works with a 5-workspace setup. If you want it to
work with X desktops either comment that one out and uncomment the general
command, or replace &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; with X and &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; with X - 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then add &lt;strong&gt;xbindkeys&lt;/strong&gt; (no arguments) to your startup applications. If you want windows to &amp;quot;edge switch&amp;quot; (switch workspaces when you drag them across the side of your screen), look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/263508/add-screen-actions-with-brightside"&gt;brightside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://forum.pinguyos.com/Thread-HOWTO-Mouse-buttons-to-change-workspaces-in-gnome-shell"&gt;HOWTO: Mouse buttons to change workspaces in gnome-shell&lt;/a&gt; helped me figure out how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
