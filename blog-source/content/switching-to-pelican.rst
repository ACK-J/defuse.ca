This blog used to be a Ruby on Rails app that I wrote myself. It was way too
time consuming to keep updating Ruby and Ruby on Rails (for security patches),
so I gave up. This blog is now just static ``.html`` files generated from
``.rst`` files with `Pelican`_.

.. _`Pelican`: http://blog.getpelican.com/

Hopefully I'll find, or create, a better theme soon!
